## Final project - Social graphs and interactions

In this repository you will find the final project in Social graphs and interactions. 
In the project we investigate sentiment for courses at DTU based
on course contents and student evaluations. Student evaluations and course contents can be found in folder `Evaluation_semesters` and `course_content` respectively.

The `Pictures` folder holds all figures created running the main notebook **dtu_courses_analysis.ipynb**. This notebook use functions from **form_extractor.py** and **network_functions.py** to create and analyse the network and extract .html files.

Enjoy!
