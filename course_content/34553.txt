the course will present the theory behind the most commonly used pv characterization and imaging methods  the course will also provide lectures that describe in detail how crystalline silicon modules are fabricated  these lectures will be followed by lab exercises where all students will perform various electrical  thermal and optical pv characterization techniques  and also build their own mini module  the course will conclude with group work on laboratory assignments  and the students will present their results in an oral presentation  and participate in an informal  create the best module competition  lectures  exercises in the field and in the lab  and group project work the course applied photovoltaics is a laboratory course that provides hands on experience in photovoltaic  pv  module fabrication and characterization  the student will be presented with the theory behind the most commonly used pv characterization methods in pv research and industry  hands on characterization of pv devices and pv power electronic converters will be performed in the lab and in the field  including measurements of the device s electrical  thermal  and optical characteristics  furthermore  the student will perform three different pv imaging techniques and will be able to differentiate each technique with its distinctive advantages when analyzing pv failures  some of these characterizations and imaging techniques will be performed on a mini pv module that is designed and built by the students themselves  moreover  the student will also be acquainted with techniques for measuring the solar resource  shading at the site and analyzing pv plant performance data teachers  sergiu spataru  sune thorsteinsson  gisele alves dos reis benatto  markus babin  daniel alvarez mira  rodrigo del prado santamaria  martin bartholom√§us
