linear equations and linear maps  matrix algebra  vektor spaces  eigenvalue problems  symmetric and orthogonal matrices  complex numbers  linear differential equations  standard functions  functions of one and several real variables  linear approximations and partial derivatives  taylor expansions and quadratic forms  extrema and level curves  line  surface and volume integrals  vector fields  gauss  and stokes  theorem  applications of maple in the above areas  examples of applications in the engineering sciences per week  2 lectures for scheme c  video lectures in danish or physical lectures together with course 01006 if seats are available   3h tutorials and 3h groupwork  moreover thematic exercises and projectwork in some weeks the course content is the mathematical basis for a broad range of technical fields and also provides a starting point for further studies in mathematics and applied mathematics  the dominating theme of the course is linearity  the goal is to give students the ability to employ fundamental tools of mathematics in theoretical studies as well as in applied thematic exercises and projects  the use of modern computer software supports both of these aspects the course is a two semester course for students following one of the preliminary four semester programs  scheme a for the programs electrical engineering  design and innovation  life science  environmental engineering  medicine   technology  human life science engineering  sustainable energy design  scheme b for the programs architectural engineering  civil engineering  data science  earth and space physics and engineering  mathematics and technology  mechanical engineering and physics and nanotechnology  scheme c for software technology  in fall cyber technology is on scheme a and in spring on scheme b
