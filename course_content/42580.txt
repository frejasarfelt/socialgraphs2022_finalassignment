the course is an introduction to engineering work with the aim of developing students  abilities to understand the connection between strategic intentions and decision making processes in practical engineering assignments  the course deals with basic analysis and structuring of complex decisions  through which students are introduced to a number of qualitative and quantitative methods that can be used to support long term strategic decisions  the course work will be concentrated on a larger case  where the students use the above methods to analyze the problem  the case will deal with specific sustainability related issues from the industry  the course thus provides the student with knowledge of several methods of strategic analysis and decision support  including an understanding of how they are used  how they can be combined and their advantages and disadvantages  after the course  the students will be able to analyze and structure decision making problems  select appropriate methods and apply these to specific decision making problems lectures and project carried out in groupsthe course makes use of  johnson  whittington  scholes  angwin   regn√©r  2021   fundamentals of strategy  pearson education limited  harlow  uk  5th edition   and compendium material the course aims to introduce strategic analysis and decision oriented engineering tasks  including starting to build a professional vocabulary  the focus will also be on practicing skills in problem formulation  problem solving  documentation and oral and written presentation of assignments  through a case  the course will introduce and apply specific methods and subject areas for the work s activities  through the course  the students will gain both theoretical and practical understanding of different methods for strategic analysis and decision support as well as understanding of concepts such as technological systems  companies and industries  the methods will be both qualitative and quantitative and cover decisions with different time horizons  and decisions with several criteria   goals  the course will also enable students to understand how a strategy sets the framework for decision making processes  in addition  dtu forms of study such as lectures  self study  group work and small project work will be introduced to the students  there will be a strong focus on describing the context for strategy and decision oriented engineering tasks this course is an introductory mandatory element of the bachelor program in data science and management and can only be taken by students in that program this course is an introductory mandatory element of the bachelor program in data science and management and can only be taken by students in that program
