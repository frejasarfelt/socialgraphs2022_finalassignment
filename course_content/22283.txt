the course introduces molecular thermodynamics from a chemical  physical and biological perspective    in the first part  we will cover the forces between macromolecules or between such molecules and solid surfaces  as well as the key importance of entropy to understand and predict molecular interactions  including binding affinity and binding rates between an analyte and a target molecule    in the second part  we will explore both passive and active transport mechanisms  and link these properties to biological and bioanalytical processes  you will also be introduced to numerical simulation tools for analyzing the properties of simplified biosensor designs    in the third and last part of the course  we will survey key analysis methods to characterize molecular interaction and transport properties with an outset in real world academic and industrial applications lectures  problem sessions  classroom discussions  exercises molecular driving forces  statistical thermodynamics in biology  chemistry  physics and nanoscience   second edition  ken  a  dill and sarina bromberg  garland science  isbn 978 0 8153  4430 8    howard berg  random walks in biology  1993  152 p   princeton university press  isbn 0691000646  handouts will be provided during the course and will be part of the course curriculum the objective of the course is to provide insight into thermodynamics and transport processes at the length scale of individual biomolecules and other macromolecules  the aim is to give you an understanding of the forces and phenomena that drive molecular interactions in biological and biochemical systems and devices at the nano  to microscale
