1  application of kinematical and kinetic theory  incl  newton s laws  for setting up equations of motions for vibrating mechanical systems   2  vibrations of linear single degree of freedom systems  free and forced vibration  damping  3  vibrations of linear multiple degree of freedom systems  equations of motion  lagrange s equations  modal analysis  rayleigh s quotient and method  vibration damping  4  vibrations of linear continuous systems  equations of motion  rayleigh s quotient and method  transverse vibration of strings  axial and torsional vibrations of rods  introduction to transverse vibrations of beams  5  introduction to nonlinear vibration analysis lectures  demo experiments  problem solvingmechanical structures and mechanisms often operate under many forms of dynamic vibrating oscillating loading  or work by exerting vibrations on other structures or processes  think of parts in cars  airplanes  turbines  pumps  wind turbines  percussion drillers  music instruments  etc  etc  mathematical modeling and analysis is decisive for predicting  limiting  eliminating  amplifying  controlling  or just understanding such influences and processes  and thus also for mechanical design and troubleshooting  this course provides a fundamental theoretical background for solving vibration problems related to mechanical structures and machinery  and for advanced studies in dynamics and vibrations
