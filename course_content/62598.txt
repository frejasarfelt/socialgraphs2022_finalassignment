introduction to artificial intelligence  problem solving by statespace search  we will analyse and implement algorithms to find a route through a maze  the shortest paths between cities  planning problems etc  design and implementation of a game  we will learn how a computer plays chess  and we will implement our own chess program or another game of your own choise  game theory  algorithm analysis  data structures first part of the course will be theory and experiments with simple games   the rest of the course is a team project  here you will implement a game of you own choice  until now students have implemented  chess  checkers  reversi  backgammon  five in a row  and halma  finaly we have a tournament  where the programs compete compenduimstrategic games are games with well defined rules for the course of the game  and a strategy for applying these rules with the purpose of winning  examples are tic tac toe  checkers  and chess witch are so called perfect information games  and games with chance ex  back gammon  strategic games serves as models for problem solving methods in computer science  methods that are applied in engineering tasks such as vlsi design  robot navigation  jobshop planning etc
