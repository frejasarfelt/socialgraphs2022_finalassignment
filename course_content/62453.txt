the project begins with an analysis of the heart as an electrophysiological measurement object  including ecg signal generation  voltage levels in given derivations and frequency content  further  the most common sources of noise when recording an ecg are studied  the ecg signal as a tool for the diagnosis of heart diseases is then studied with examples   an ecg measurement system comprising  electrodes  amplifier  filter  a d conversion and transmission of data from a microcontroller to a pc  is developed and constructed  pc software for obtaining  analysing  and presenting the recorded ecg data  is developed   work in this project with ecg signals recorded from subjects and preliminary analysis of these signals project with group project supervision material and equipment are handed out when the project starts the overall course objective is to provide students with practical experience in     analysing a biological organ as electrophysical measuring object   analys  design  development  test and use of an electronic measuring system for measuring a biological signal   collecting  analysing and presenting measurement data from a patient simulator and test subject
