the course will provide an overview of different state of the art sensing  communication and computing technologies  whose functions are based on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics  the fundamental principles will be introduced and specialised protocols such as quantum magnetometry  phase estimation  quantum cryptography  quantum repeaters  boson sampling and quantum machine learning will be discussed lectures and problem solvingapplied quantum physics is the basis for development of emerging quantum information technologies  the goal of the course is to give the student an advanced insight into the physics and principles of quantum information technologies and practical aspects of how such technologies are implemented and operated  as well as methods for analysing and assessing their performance  thus  the course provides a solid foundation for continued studies and research within quantum technologies
