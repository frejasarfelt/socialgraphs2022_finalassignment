the scientific papers discussed in this course range from fundamental  highly cited papers in the field of quantum information technology to recent papers dealing with advanced structures with implementations of quantum information technology  at each meeting  the students take turns at presenting the material  which papers to be studied is continually discussed  such that also up to date scientific papers may be included  in contrast to the course provided at dtu fysik  journal club in quantum optics   7 5 ects   this journal club has a theoretical approach to quantum informatics and considers implementations in semiconductor materials to provide the participants with a fundamental knowledge of basic principles in quantum information technology and to relate this to new approaches in the field  the main focus in this journal club is on implementation in semiconductor structures
