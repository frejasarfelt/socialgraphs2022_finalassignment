the course introduces elements of cognitive science in relation to artificial intelligence through lectures and exercises  the students acquire practical experience with experimental methods in cognitive science and user experience design through the exercises lectures on cognitive science in relation to artificial intelligence  practicals in experiments and data analysis in cognitive sciencein many tasks  artificial intelligence  ai  aims to solve problems that humans can solve such as object recognition  classification and motor control  although the tasks humans and computers solve can seem similar they may differ in terms of goals  training data and available processing power  the underlying computations and algorithms in ai systems might also be very different from those implemented in the human brain   this course presents elements of cognitive science and neuroscience illustrating how the human brain process information and relates this to information processing in ai systems
