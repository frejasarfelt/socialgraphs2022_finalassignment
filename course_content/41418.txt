the course deals with fuels  and chemicals  such as methanol  dimethyl ether  dme   methane  ammonia and jet fuel  and answers questions such as  what are the advantages and disadvantages of each fuel  how can these fuels be produced  what is the appropriate end use of a certain fuel  what is the climate impact  economic performance and the overall energy efficiency of a certain fuel   the main technologies covered in the course include  thermal gasification and pyrolysis of biomass  electrolysis  catalytic synthesis of fuels and chemicals  but also carbon capture and storage  ccs  for hydrogen production from natural gas  as well as carbon capture and use  ccu    during the course you will conduct a design project in a group about green fuels or power to x  the project may focus on a specific fuel and could cover the following parts  1  a description of the fuel  and advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative fuels  2  the potential role in a green energy system  3  possible production pathways and indicative economics of selected pathways  4  a thermodynamic simulation of a simplified production system or a more detailed simulation of key parts of a production system  this simulation will be done by using a component based thermodynamic software such dna  developed at the department  or the commercial software aspen plus lectures  exercises and design project to enable students to evaluate green fuels and power to x  including the role in a future green energy system  and advantages and disadvantages of the various fuels  a main objective is to learn how to design  model and analyse fuel production systems taking emissions  economics and thermodynamic performance into account  note that power to x covers production of many different products that can be produced from power  electricity   this course will focus on the production of fuels from power  but also on the production of chemicals such as methanol and ammonia  power to heat by using a heat pump is not a part of the course
