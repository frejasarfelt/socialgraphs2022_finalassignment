fusion energy research aims at realising the dream of a sustainable  large scale source of energy that can continually contribute to the energy supply of the world  this would contribute to the un sustainable development goal  7  affordable and clean energy  fusion energy research encompasses a wide range of scientific  technical  and engineering disciplines  the course aims at providing the students with an overview of the interplay between these disciplines and the importance for reaching the overall goal  the course will also allow the students to discover how their specific scientific engineering interests potentially could contribute to the development of fusion energy  initially  the course will put fusion energy research in perspective  followed by an introduction of a series of topics as plasma physics  nuclear physics  energy systems  fusion diagnostics  materials for fusion reactors  status of current fusion experiments etc  the second element of the course is a group based literature self study of an elective topic with relation to fusion research  the group work is concluded by a poster session  where the specific topics are presented to the other course paticipants  at the last part of the course  the tool stakeholder management is presented and used on stakeholders and cases in relation to fusion energy lectures  guest lectures  group work  literature study  poster sessionthe overall aim of the course is to be able to see the context of fusion energy research   both scientifically and societal  you will be able to see how a range of scientific and engineering disciplines must contribute in correspondence to develop a fusion power plant
