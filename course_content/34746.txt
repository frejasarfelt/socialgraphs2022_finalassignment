the course deals with novel control methods and concepts in the area of robust and optimal control  fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control   robust and optimal control are applied where the controller needs to be independent of variations in the control object  i e  the effect from the variations on the performance is minimal  fault diagnosis is applied for detection and or isolating faults in dynamical systems  faults can e g  be a sensor break down  a valve is not working optimal  etc  fault diagnosis is applied for supervision of dynamical systems in connection with fault tolerant control  when major changes happen in the control object or in the controller due to e g  faults in the system  it can be necessary to make changes in the controller control architecture to avoid undesired stop of production  break down or safety hazards  this can be done in a systematic way by using fault tolerant control  where the control system is reconfigured or the control object is closed down in a safe way   the first part of the course includes an introduction to the other parts of the course   both analysis and design methods will be presented  the participants will work actively with analysis and design and real application cases are used to illustrate the concepts  participants will work with the latest generation of dedicated software for the analysis and design of fault tolerant and robust control systems   a number of small exercises examples will be applied together with two larger assignments with associated test setup in the laboratory lectures  group work  simulation and programming exercises m  blanke  m  kinnaert  j  lunze and m  staroswiecki  diagnosis and fault tolerant control  3nd ed   springer 2015  and s  skogestad and i  postlethwaite  multivariable feedback control   analysis and design  2nd ed  wiley general objectives    to teach the basic in robust control  fault diagnosis and fault tolerant control   to show applications   show how to use robust cantrol and fault tolerant control   to be able to evaluate advantages and disadvantages in connection with application of robust control and fault tolerant control e learning is used in the form of discussion board or blog
