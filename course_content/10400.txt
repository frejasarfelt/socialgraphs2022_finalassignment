fundamental equations of motion for populations of charged particles in electromagnetic fields including self generated fields   magnetohydrodynamic  continuum and kinetic descriptions  plasma equilibrium states and criteria for stability  collisions  wave phenomena in plasma  resonance and total reflection  elementary dielectric effects in thermal plasmas  plasma in space and laboratory  fusion plasma lectures and exercisesfrancis f chen  introduction to plasma physics and controlled fusion  springer  2016  3rd edition  and m salewski  lecture notesthe objective is to give the students an understanding of what a plasma is  how it behaves  which scientific and industrial contexts plasmas appear in  the course will give the student insight into how the dynamics in plasma is modeled mathematically and numerically  and on the basis of simplified models give the student the ability to model fundamental plasma phenomena  acquired knowledge from this course provides a foundation for advanced studies of fusion plasmas  astrophysical plasmas and process plasmas that are applied in a broad range of industrial processes
