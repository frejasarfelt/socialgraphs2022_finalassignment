exact algebraic computation  arithmetic in finite fields  with polynomials over finite fields and over integers  and with matrices over finite fields and over integers  algorithms for factoring  ideals in noetherian rings  especially multivariate polynomial rings  gr√∂bner bases and buchberger s algorithm lectures  exercises  assignmentsa standard reference is j  von zur gathen  j  gerhard  modern computer algebra  3rd ed this is a course about ingenious methods for solving algebraic questions  such as factoring polynomials over a finite field  or finding simultaneous roots to several multivariate polynomials  we are in a discrete and exact arena  integers  fractions  finite fields and polynomials  and our main concern will be to study algorithms that are fast for very large input   if you like discrete mathematics  you will like this course because we will dig deep into beautiful and surprising algebraic properties that can be turned into concrete recipes for solving problems  abstract algebra will become concrete and hands on by understanding how to actually solve algebraic questions   we will take a mathematically stringent approach with proofs of algebraic theorems  algorithms  correctness and their complexity  we will mix this with experimentation with a computer algebra program
