theoretical background for road traffic technique  simulation of road transport  model integration in simulation programs and evaluation of solutions introductory lectures on road traffic engineering  road traffic simulation and behavioural models  and introduction to the vissim micro simulation software  after these lectures the students work in groups  max  2 persons  on a specific assignment and prepare a presentation  a number of different cases are considered so that both non signalised and signalised intersections  round abouts and ramps with fletches are simulated the aim of the course is to provide the students with a basic knowledge of road traffic engineering and micro simulation of road transport as concerns behavioral models for road transport  and to make the students able to use  run  calibrate and validate an existing software for the most common types of roads digital tools  vissim
