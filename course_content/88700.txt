a major part of chemical reactions in production processes and in gas cleaning processes takes place in multi phase reactors  e g  production of pharmaceuticals  calcination of lime in the production of calcium hydroxide  production of cement  combustion of solid and liquid fuels in the production of power and heat  catalytic and non catalytic cleaning of flue gas and catalytic production of important products in different reactors including two or more phases  the examples are homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysed  gas solid  gas liquid  liquid solid and gas liquid solid reactions that take place in a number of different reactor types  batch fixed bed  moving bed  spray absorbers  packed towers  membrane reactors  fluidized bed reactors  entrained flow reactors etc    the theory covering the different types of reactions and a number of the reactors is expounded together with examples  during the semester the students cooperate in teams solving practical oriented reactor design problems the course will consist of ordinary lectures  individual home assignments and two comprehensive course assignments to be solved in groups to provide the students with a fundamental and practically applicable understanding of industrial important types of reactions and reactors that can be used in chemical and biochemical production processes and in pollution control the course can only be taken by students in sdc program   chemical and biochemical engineering  biomass and energy  the course content will be partly identical to dtu course 28443 industrial reaction engineering
