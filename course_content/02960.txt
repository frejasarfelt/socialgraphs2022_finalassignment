generally  one will need a self tuning model for each component in a system  which has only the complexity needed for the particular application  for example  a building with pv and a heat pump  one will need a model from weather forecasts and control variables to  power from the pv  load from the heat pump and the indoor temperature in the building  these  in combination with electricity prices  will in an mpc control be able to optimize the operation of the heat pump and shift the load to achieve the cheapest operation  there are many other applications of the data driven models  e g  performance assessment and fault detection  these will also be presented with examples  the statistical techniques behind the models will be elaborated  with focus on non linear models  both discrete  kernels and splines  and continuous  grey box modelling with sdes  summer school held at dtu i collaboration with ntnu  the summer school is arranged by the centers cities http   smart cities centre org  and zen www sintef no prosjekter zen  as a starting point familiarity with time series analysis as presented in http   henrikmadsen org books time series analysis   the particular material for the course will be handed out to the participants to give a hands on introduction to the statistical techniques  which are highly useful for modelling based on data observed from energy systems  as well as the use of these e g  for control
