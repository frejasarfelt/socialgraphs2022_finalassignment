the first part of the course begins with the fundamentals of photoelectric conversion  charge excitation  separation  and collection  various topics  such as doping in semiconductors  drift  diffusion and illumination current in a p n junction will be only briefly covered  we will work together through a theoretical exercise that seeks to provide understanding of the upper theoretical efficiency of a single junction solar cell  we will provide the basis for understanding the key properties of the materials used to make photovoltaic devices  for example the transparent conductive oxides  tco  used in thin film solar cells  an overview of the commercial solar cell technologies  cdte and cuingase2  cigs    as well as emerging thin film technologies  organic solar cells  perovskites  cu2znsns4  czts   two dimensional materials  etc   will be given  several lectures covering the basics of photovoltaics will be made available online   in the second part of the course  the outlined laboratory sessions will give the students the possibility to measure and evaluate commercial thin film solar cell devices  such as cdte and cigs  furthermore  the students will gain hands on experience with thin film deposition and characterization of emerging solar cell absorbers composed of abundant and environmentally friendly elements  e g  czts   the course will comprise of theoretical and laboratory exercise for which submission of reports is required   the second week of the course will take place at dtu ris√∏ campus lectures  theoretical exercises  laboratorythe aim of the course is to introduce the students to the field of thin film photovoltaics  the course covers the fundamental aspects of photovoltaics  which is the technology that allows the conversion of light directly into electrical energy  a strong focus will be on the different thin film technologies  including materials  production methods and characterization approaches  research reviews and hands on experiments in the dtu photovoltaic laboratories will give the students the possibility to learn about different thin film deposition methods  moreover  the students will be able to measure and evaluate the performance of the thin film photovoltaic devices  both commercial ones and samples made at dtu here i request moving the 3 week course 34551 thin film photovoltaics from january 2023 to june 2023  this is a one time request because the course co responsible  sara engberg  is on maternity leave  and she will return in june 2023  this is a very intensive course with lectures  theoretical exercises  and laboratory exercises  4 in total   and nearly impossible to run it  alone  we are typically 5 people incl  including students    best wishes  stelateachers  stela canulescu  sara lena josefin engberg  eugen stamate
