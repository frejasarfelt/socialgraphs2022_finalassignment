the course covers a wide range of subjects in the field of energy research  energy conversion and storage  including fuel cells  batteries  solar cells and caloric energy conversion  these topics are presented by a series of researchers who actively work on these topics  the purpose of the course is to ensure that the phd students are well informed in all areas of energy conversion and storage  including areas they do not specialize in  the specific content of the course changes from semester to semester depending on the teachers and guests participating in the course  and depending on the interests of the participating students   additionally  the course will contain presentations on scientific communication  and the student will be trained in making effectives slides and in making the good oral presentation  during the course  the student will give two presentations  one will be a short summary of his her phd project  the other will be on a topic within energy research currently unknown to the student  chosen in agreement with the course responsibles  for the oral exam  the student will choose a number of the other students  presentations  one of which will be randomly chosen at the oral exam  where the student must then explain the main topics and ideas of the presentation  a scientific article within energy research  energy conversion and storage  given to the student in advance of the exam  must also be presented at the oral exam lectures presented by guests on topics in contemporary energy research  and presentations by the students  two presentations each  to provide the students with knowledge about subjects in modern research on energy conversion and storage  as well as presentation training this course introduces students to a range of subjects in modern research on energy conversion and storage  and at the same time improves the students  presentation skills for each student a minimum of 80   presence is mandatory
