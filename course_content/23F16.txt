surveillance of foodborne pathogens in animals  food and humans is the basis for successful control and prevention  it is through surveillance that we retrieve data on the burden of foodborne illnesses and the pathogens  prevalence and distribution  which is knowledge needed to track and identify sources of infection and implement effective interventions  it is also through surveillance that we first detects if a foodborne outbreak is underway  and later hypothesize and trace potential sources of infection    finding the specific source of an outbreak is often a complicated piece of detective work that requires good collaboration between authorities  researchers and industry  including between human and veterinary epidemiologists and microbiologists  in addition to stopping the outbreak so that further cases of disease are avoided  a successful resolution of an outbreak also often provides new knowledge about sources of infection or routes of infection that can be used for future prevention and control    tracing of sources of infection often requires combining the results of microbiological and epidemiological studies  microbiological methods are used to uniquely identify bacteria and separate them at the subspecies level  in the course  we will provide an introduction to the most commonly used typing methods used for surveillance and outbreak tracing  including mlst and whole genome sequencing  wgs     epidemiological methods include interview studies  e g  case control and cohort studies   which aim to identify possible sources of infection by asking patients and healthy people about their intake of different foods in a given period and then make a statistical comparison of their responses  epidemiology is also about describing the course of the outbreak and defining the extent both geographically and temporally  as well as characterizing the patients  including age and gender etc  such information forms among others the basis for generating hypotheses about the source of infection   the teaching will consist of e lectures  q a sessions  and assignments  the majority of the course material will be provided during the course  selected chapters from textbooks  scientific articles  popular science articles  newspaper article  reference webpages   information about the software that will be used for source tracking and outbreak investigation will be provided at course start up in this course  we will review the microbiological and epidemiological methods we use to survey foodborne illnesses and pathogens and to trace sources of infection for both sporadic and outbreak related cases  all methods are internationally recognized tools  but the methods and not least the results can often be difficult to interpret in the right perspective    the purpose of the course is therefore also to provide an understanding of the methods  strengths and weaknesses  the course will review the concepts of sensitivity and specificity of monitoring methods and discuss their significance and sample sizes for what is observed  the course will also take participants through the steps in solving foodborne outbreaks  and the whole thing will be spiced up with real life examples and case studies the course is part of the  master of sustainable and safe food production  the course is offered in the spring in uneven years  i e  2023  2025  etc
