the content will cover both kinetic aspects  enzymes  aggregation  as well as thermodynamics  ligand binding  protein folding  protein protein interactions  phase separation  of protein reactions  some aspects  such as protein folding will be partly discussed with the help of toy models  but overall the emphasis will be on the analysis of real world data from the literature or our own research projects  the students will be equipped with a very large tool kit to quantitatively analyse basically any relevant type of interaction that proteins can undergo  both from the kinetic and thermodynamic standpoint lectures  recorded lectures  case stories  problem solving  data analysisa course compendium and other relevant material will be provided on dtu learn  which contains materials from   	klostermeyer et al   biophysical chemistry  	dill et al   molecular driving forces  	philips et al   physical biology of the cell  	bahar et al   protein actions   principles and modeling  	barrick   biomolecular thermodynamics  	etc the course presents thermodynamic  and kinetic principles and concepts that are commonly used in protein science  we will introduce the theoretical framework for this field  and focus particularly on practical skills for the quantitative analyses of biochemical and biophysical processes  the course will enable the student to formally describe the rates and strength of ligand binding to proteins  as well as the energetics of protein folding and  stability  other examples include the analysis of protein aggregation and phase separation assays  the interaction of proteins with lipids and nucleic acids particular emphasis will be put on the students  ability to handle  analyse and visualize real world experimental data  to evaluate different theoretical models and to perform statistical analysis
