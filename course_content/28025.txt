this compact course will be taught in one semester and focuses at the basic principles of chemical process engineering applied to examples from chemical and biochemical engineering and medicine techniques     it covers the systematic mass and energy balances for chemical and biochemical processes with and without chemical reactions  a number of typical problems from industrial biochemical processes serve as examples  the intention is to illustrate practical applications and to form a background for understanding of the quantitative methods described in the course   flow  the mechanical energy balance  flow of gases and liquids  calculation of friction losses in pipe systems  pumps and design of pipe systems   filtration  fundamental principles and applied examples   heat transfer  heat transfer by conduction  convection and condensation  design of heat exchangers  mass transfer  differential mass balances  diffusion  rate dependent mass transfer operations lecture and class exercisespauline m  doran  bioprocess engineering principles  2nd editionthe aim of this course is to give an introduction to the principles of bioprocess engineering in a way that is accesible to biological scientists  the material presented in this course is suited to teach undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds in biology  chemistry and medical science  the lectures are organised around broad engineering subdisciplines such as mass and energy balances  fluid dynamics  transport phenomena and reaction theory   the students will after the course be able to work with the description of an engineering problem and be able to solve the problem by using the given information  e g  in literature   they will be familiar with the fundamental principles behind a number of important types of process equipment and to get a general knowledge of such equipment  they will be able to make quantitative calculations to design process equipment and to predict performance and capacity of existing equipment when the operating conditions are changed introduction to chemical and biochemical engineering  unit operations of chemical engineering and biotechnology
