the design and assessment part concerns mechanical material properties  theory and calculation methods for elastic and plastic analysis  as well as calculation methods for assessment of beams  columns and connections for bolted and welded steel structures   the science part trains the student in acquiring and handling the matematical and technical science based derivations of equilibrium and displacement differential equations for beams and columns with and without elastic foundation  furthermore the basic stiffness calulation rules for beam and spring systems will be covered   the implementation and execution part introduces theory for element calculations of frame and truss structures  exercises are performed with the use of a relevant digital element program  digital design and assessment of steel structures using an element program will be introduced lectures  exercises  class teaching and  group assignments steel structures according to ds en 1993 1 1 praxis   nyt teknisk forlagthe student acquires knowledge and skills in design and assessment of conventional steel structures for building and infrastructure construction following present structural standards  it is the aim that the student acquires skills in design and assessment of structural elements and connections  so that they can be implemented  furthermore it is the aim to teach the student to understand the overall behavior of space frames and truss systems  as well as to use a conventional digital frame element program to perform analysis and design of such structures research group  building technology and processes  building and civil engineering  3rd or 4th semester the course is a compulsory part of the  constructions     building technology  subjects arctic civil engineering  4th or 5th semester4th semester students participate in an study tour where they work together with students from european universities  which is part of the program s constituent element  course content relates to the study tour s site visits  internationalsteel structures
