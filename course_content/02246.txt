the course covers three main topics    1  methods for modeling systems with features such as non determinism  probabilistic stochastic aspects  and multiple agents objectives  transition systems  markov models  and games   2  logical formalisms for expressing properties related to the safety  security  and performance of systems    3  validation and verification tools that determine the relationship between models and properties in order to establish strong guarantees related to safety  security  and performance lectures  theoretical exercises  and practical exercises excerpts from relevant text books  e g  baier   katoen  principles of model checking  mit press model checking is a set of modelling and analysis techniques combining logic  graph based models of computation  automata  transitions systems  markov chains       probabilities  statistics  and game theory  following this course the students will be able to apply model checking techniques for modelling  specification and validation verification for various classes of systems  distributed concurrent systems  schedulers  controllers  networks  biological systems  games  etc
