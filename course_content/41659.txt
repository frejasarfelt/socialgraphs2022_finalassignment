the course covers materials in general  but with main emphasis on metallic materials  polymers  ceramics  and composites supplement  we focus on the interrelation in structure and properties of materials as well as processing and synthesis  the course content includes  i  basic concepts  atomic bonds  crystal structure  lattice defects  amorphous and semi crystalline materials  ii  microstructure  phase equilibria and phase diagrams  phase transformations  iii  mechanical properties and degradation the teaching is based on active participation of students in group work  there will be introductory and summing up lectures  project work and presentations whether choosing a material to make tennis rackets  contact lenses  or jet engines  always the material s properties are essential both in relation to the application and the manuafcturing process of an industrial product  this course provides a broad general knowledge on materials and considers environmental sustainability for materials selection and applications  furthermore  it will inspire some students to continue with specialized studies within materials engineering  the course aims to give an understanding of the characteristics of the various types of materials and their potential applications  the basis for such understanding is obtained by focusing on the relationship between the internal structure of materials and related properties of metals  polymers  ceramics and composites the course is a basic materials science course dedicated to students from the bachelor program in mechanical engineering at dtu the course includes project work with poster preparation and presentations which contribute to the final grade
