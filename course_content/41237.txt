the fundamental concepts of dynamics are introduced for simple systems with a single degree of freedom  hereby  aspects such as natural frequencies  damping and resonance are introduced by determining the system s free vibrations and its forced response to harmonic and transient loading   the foundation of the dynamics of flexible structures is subsequently described by the theory for free beam vibrations  while the connection between this continuous element and its corresponding discrete structural model is illustrated by applying the finite element method to solve the partial differential equation  the dynamic analysis of discrete structures with multiple degrees of freedom is then conducted by modal analysis  based on a series representation by the vibration forms of the structure  hereby  the influence of the load s frequency content and its spatial distribution is considered  together with the potential of quasi static system reduction techniques   for flexible structures  the damping of the system is crucial for the magnitude of the dynamic response  why various naturally occurring damping mechanisms are scrutinized  furthermore  the effect of external dampers on flexible structures is treated  including the use of tuned mass dampers  for flexible structures with local dampers or advanced loading  the dynamic equations are solved by direct time integration using the newmark method   the theoretical content of the course is treated in exercises  which can be solved in python  the reports constitute a part of the total course assessment  the first report is handed in individually  while the subsequent two reports are prepared in groups lectures and exercises including numerical work  reports are prepared individually or in groups of either two or three students  depending on the number of course participants the dynamic excitation of civil engineering structures often occurs due to environmental forces from wind  waves and earthquakes  or from traffic loading  collisions and explosions  the aim of this course is to provide an understanding of dynamic effects in large structures and enable students to perform dynamic analysis of structures with a single or multiple degrees of freedom  using analytical as well as numerical methods
