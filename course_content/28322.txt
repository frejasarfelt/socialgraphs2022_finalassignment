application of equations of state to calculate thermodynamic properties  including residual properties  of pure fluids  e g  co2   sizing and optimization for cooling and liquefaction processes  physical chemical models applicable for  separation of most liquid solutions  models for real liquid solutions and their use in equilibrium calculations of liquid vapor  liquid liquid and solid liquid systems  experimental data is used to evaluate the models classroom lectures and tutorials the autumn semester is taught mainly in english  the spring semester is taught mainly in danish sizing and optimization of process units  distillation  extraction  compression  cooling etc   requires thorough knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of the chemical species  pure mixture  present  physical chemistry provides the theoretical framework which makes the calculation of these properties possible with  approximate models  even with limited availability of experimental data  the goal of this course is to enable the participants to estimate thermodynamic properties of pure species and mixtures for application in sizing and optimization of process units teaching responsible fall  xiaodong liang and wei yan   the course will be mostly given in english teaching responsible spring  philip loldrup fosb√∏l and wei yan   the course will be mostly given in danish
