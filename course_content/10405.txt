the course treats the special theory of relativity  the starting point is electromagnetic phenomena  in particular the electromagnetic fields around a point charge as observed in different inertial systems  then follows a discussion on the  form invariance of the laws of physics as well as the two postulates of einstein  and the lorentz transformation is derived and used to prove lorentz contraction  time dilation  and the concept of relativistic simultaneity  transformation of particle position  velocity  and acceleration is treated  and invariant quantities are sen to lead to space time diagrams  4 vectors  and proper time  4 vectors are applied to  particle dynamics  energy momentum 4 vector  the center of mass concept  as well as relativistic energy  kinetic and reaction energy   and energy momentum conservation is applied to elastic scattering  the compton effect   relativistic doppler effect is treated  followed by a relativistic description of plane waves  the 4 vector phase  and the group and phase velocity  finally  elements of relativistic electrodynamics and the lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic fields are treated  and the dirac equation in the relativistic quantum theory of the electron is derived   the general theory of relativity is introducered in a breif overview and its importance for the gps technology is discussed  throughout the course are given examples of applications of the theory within electromagnetism  atomic physics  high energy physics  and astro physics lectures and problem solvingd  j  griffiths   introduction to electrodynamics  and lecture notesto give the student a basic understanding of the special theory of relativity and its importance for modern physics  examples of applications  of the theory are studied in the context of electromagnetism  atomic physics  high energy physics  and astrophysics
