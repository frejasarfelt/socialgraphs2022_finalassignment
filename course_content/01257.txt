we make a mathematical model of a scientific problem originating in for instance engineering or physics  and we analyse the model using mathematical theory  in addition the model is implemented numerically and through numerical simulations the phenomena are investigated  the problem could for instance arise from structural mechanics  students that have taken course 01617 will be offered tailored projects where students will be able to apply dynamical systems theory to real world problems  students are expected to work in groups  2 4 persons  with the concrete project full day sessions in 3 weeks with projectwork in groups to introduce the students to advanced mathematical modelling through the solution of a project problem from engineering  medicine or physics  most projects will be about models of differential equations  the course is therefore a natural next step for students of 01617  providing a unique opportunity for putting some theoretical knowledge into practice
