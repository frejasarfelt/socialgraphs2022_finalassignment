the course covers four major topics  in the first part  the various types of electricity markets are described  with emphasis placed on market clearing procedures and their formulation as optimization problems  we aim at understanding and analysing the impact of renewable energy on the market clearing outcomes  and on the revenues or participants  in the second part  we interpret market clearing problem from a game theoretic perspective  we then model and analyze the interaction of market actors through various game theoretic models  in the third part  the course will focus on the problem of designing optimal offering strategies in electricity markets with high penetration of renewable energy sources  and valuing these strategies in practice  we will explore optimal offering strategies for both price taker and price maker actors  in the last part  we will incorporate the operational unit commitment constraints of conventional generators into market clearing problem  we will then focus on quantification of required reserve for renewable based electricity markets lectures  exercises  computer exercises  project workelectricity markets are today central in the way we exchange electricity  the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems has a substantial and complex impact on these electricity markets  in this context  the objective of this course is to introduce the students to the fundamental aspects of renewable energy in electricity markets  from the point of view of both market operators and market participants e learning is used in the form of podcast lectures  interactive quiz  chat room  discussion board blog and web based tools
