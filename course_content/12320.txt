introduction to hydrology and the hydrological cycle  water vapour  precipitation  evaporation  evapotranspiration  climate  infiltration  darcy s law  basic principles of groundwater flow  regional groundwater and surface water  well hydraulics and capture zones  surface runoff and streamflow  hydrological modelling  snowlectures  tutorials  assignmentslecture notes and selected book chapters distributed during the coursehydrology provides the disciplinary foundations for working on water resources problems  the course develops the technical skills to quantify all aspects of the hydrological cycle in the context of engineering design problems  each component of the water cycle is covered in depth through lectures and a comprehensive suite of exercises  an understanding of physical hydrologic processes is provided  including the ability to critically analyse and apply that understanding to new problems  and where necessary further develop hydrological science for engineering application  students completing the course will have a good background for further work on water management  including such topics such as integrated water resources management  urban water management  flood control  managing climate change impacts on the water cycle  water supply  contaminated sites management etc this course teaches the knowledge that forms the basis for many advanced courses in the urban water  water resources and the soil groundwater contamination areas  we use of python and jupyter notebooks extensively for problem solving and quantitative analysis
