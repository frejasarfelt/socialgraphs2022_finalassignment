biotechnology is currently being revolutionized by rapid and extraordinary technological advances in molecular and synthetic biology that have led to unprecedented improvements in bio based production  translating this knowledge into new commercial processes demands a deep understanding of the synthetic and systems biology of living cells  and approaches for engineering cell factories  bio manufacturing is a rapidly developing field  as demand is growing to replace oil based industry with biosustainable methods for production of chemicals and proteins essential for therapeutics and other purposes  optimization of microbial cell factories through metabolic engineering is of central importance for efficient biological production of chemicals  cell factory design is informed by integrating metabolic research  synthetic biology   omics and modeling  while high throughput technologies support efficient production with high yield  at the same time synthetic biology is influencing the way we design experiments in basic research  the course brings together a group of experienced researchers to provide training on how to analyze data and think critically about state of the art cellular  molecular  and computational techniques and approaches for optimization of cell factory engineering and biosustainability  specifically  the content of the course will focus on discussing primary literature from current topics in bacterial  yeast and mammalian cell factory engineering  synthetic biology  and biosustainable production of beneficial compounds  e g  antibiotics  therapeutic proteins  students will participate in four group literature discussion sessions led by leading bioengineering researchers from the nnf center for biosustainability  a week before each session  a problem set of relevant scientific papers and questions based on their content will be provided  students must read the papers critically and submit a written report with answers to the set questions before the discussion session  the discussion will then be based on the problem set see  learning objectives  three hour discussion sessions on the following dates  extensive reading of current literature  approx  6 8 hours per session  and preparation of a written report are required in advance of each  friday 20 january  2023 friday 27 january  2023 friday 03 february  2023 friday 10 february  2023  teachers group leaders from the novo nordisk foundation center for biosustainability  technical university of denmark  http   www biosustain dtu dk
