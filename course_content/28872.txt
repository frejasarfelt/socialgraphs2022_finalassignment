the course will give a broad perspective over the biorefinery concept by introducing the key integrated processes  such as biomass production  pretreatment  and chemical   biological  and thermo chemical  conversion  the lectures will focus on bioresources and single processing steps and will include industrial and scientific examples  in the case study the students will combine multiple processing steps into a novel biorefinery concept  there will be emphasis on sustainable systems throughout the course  the course is divided into four main blocks  1  chemical characterization of biomass and recovery of biochemicals of industrial interest  calculations include mass balances and stoichiometry  2  green processes techniques used in biorefineries  enzyme technology  membrane technology  clean solvents  integration reaction separation  use of microwaves ultrasound  3  introduction to energy from biomass  physical  microbiological  and thermodynamic processes  gasification and pyrolysis  biogas   to be continued in the course  production of biofuels      4  other applications  biomaterials  5  biological treatment methods for waste and wastewater for production of bioproducts  biofuels and energylectures and project workto provide the students with basic knowledge about the biorefinery concept and integrated processes that convert biomass into multiple products of bioenergy  biomaterials and biochemicals  an important part of the course deals with the importance and the use of green chemistry and sustainability principles  and all the examples and the report are elaborated always on the basis of such principlesthe study material will be based on a compendium and international journal articles
