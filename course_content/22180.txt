the students will work in small groups throughout the whole course on problems related to antimicrobial resistance     the background of the topic will be addressed in a review project which will be summarized in written form  the knowledge will hereafter be translated into a project plan which leads to the design of a microbiological growth experiment for determination of antimicrobial resistance    antimicrobial resistance will be measured using a device which is designed and build by the students  the device is based on a 3d printed frame with a microcontroller which acquires online data using basic scripting  the innovative laboratories of skylab will support the different aspects of prototyping the device    the students will lead the project themselves with guidance from instructors  in a final oral presentation  the  conceive design implement operate  approach will be evaluated together the obtained results the course is project based and uses a mixture of lectures  exercises and lab workthis course introduces the students to the  conceive design implement operate  approach to obtain an understanding of problem based engineering   in a cross disciplinary project  the students will learn to conceive a microbiological study plan and prepare samples accordingly  hereafter a prototype instrument for measuring planned data will be designed and build  the course will partly take place at dtu skylab which will give the foundation of pursuing innovation and instrument prototyping on own initiative after the course the course is only for students enrolled in the bsc programme life science engineering and is offered for the first time in the autumn semester 2022
