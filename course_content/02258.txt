computer systems  fundamental parallel computer architecture   multi core systems  scalable architectures  heterogeneous computer  architecture  cache and memory hierarchy effects  cache coherence   memory models  cloud systems  machine learning hardware  performance  analysis   parallel programming  structured parallel programming  parallel  patterns  implementation of synchronization primitives   implementation of parallel programming frameworks   modeling  performance models  performance tools group activities  exercises and programming laboratories all modern computer systems are parallel systems  whether they are embedded  server or distributed cloud system  in this course  you will study how these systems are designed and how to efficiently program them   the course assumes knowledge of  amongst other things  programming  with threads  processes and with system languages  in particular c   based on this  you will explore how to use and implement modern  parallel computing frameworks   you will also study the system architecture of a wide range of parallel systems  the course will provide the insights needed to evaluate and design parallel systems  also at a low level   modern cloud systems and machine learning systems are parallel computers  this course will cover such system as well and will provide the necessary insight to use but also design cloud and machine learning systems
