in the 13 week period the course is organised with lectures  work shops and design tasks  in the 3 week period focus is on individual projects within construction design  energy design and indoor environment  it is concluded with an oral examination during the last part of the course  during the course design theory and calculation methods are used as tools in a holistic design process with focus on architecture  indoor environment  energy and construction  a variety of simulation and calculation tools in energy  indoor climate  outdoor climate and structures will be taught  and it will be demonstrated how these tools can be linked to design tools  cad bim  via scripting and procedural programming in grasshopper3d and dynamo lectures  self studies and teamworkthe course utilizes knowledge  tools and methods from the first four semesters of the education to perform a realistic project  quantitative requirements form the framework for the project which is developed by taking architectural intentions into account  the projekts is cross disciplinary and trains independency related to seeking  adapting and evaluating information  in addition  skills are gained in the use of digital computing and simulation tools  scripting tools like grasshopper3d and dynamo will be used in the course for the purpose of integrating computational models and design models the course is for the students on the bachelor line  architectural engineering  the course is for the students on the bachelor line  architectural engineering
