the development of advanced drug loaded nanocarriers that can deliver drugs in a targeted manner to diseased tissues  increase drug uptake and transport drugs across biological barriers is becoming increasingly important for the pharmaceutical industry and healthcare  22235 is mainly focused on the chemcical aspects of how lipidic and polymeric nanocarriers can be designed to improve efficacy and how these nanodrugs interact with the biological milieu  ranging from serum proteins to organs  22235 will introduce a range of therapeutics  pharmaco  biologic and gene  along with the lipidic and polymeric carrier chemistry  research articles in nanocarrier based drug delivery will be used as a method to introduce strategies and fundamental concepts in this research field  this will introduce both cutting edge and historical aspects of the field allowing students to understand design principles  students will analyse and evaluate these design principles  lecture slides videos will be used to introduce and or reaffirm basic concepts in drug delivery  ultimately in the project component students will design a new nanocarrier based strategy for a disease of their choice a solutions based learning approach will be used to explore the design and engineering of drug loaded nanocarriers  research and review articles in combination with lectures  slides and or videos  will be used throughout the course as learning aids peer reviewed research and review articles will be the primary literature source the objective of the course is to give students an insight into drug delivery using nanocarriers  i e  nanodrugs   which are increasingly used in healthcare  the course is focused on understanding the design principles behind drug loaded nanocarriers from the perspective of the materials used and the physiological challenges that have to be overcome
