the course focuses on molecular genetics  molecular biology and cell biology  a wide range of molecular processes like dna replication  repair and recombination  transcription  translation  post translational modifications  protein sorting and cell cycle control will be covered  for simplicity  these topics will initially be described individually and for single cell organisms like yeasts  however  during the course  complexity will gradually increase as we will see how these processes occur in complex multicellular eukaryotes  and how their actions are coordinated via global regulatory networks  for example by signal transduction pathways  in the end  this knowledge will allow us to discuss topics like developmental biology and the molecular biology of cancer  two recurrent motifs will be highlighted throughout the course  understanding the interconnectedness of physiological processes within the cell  and devising strategies to intervene in these complex processes  either to manipulate a production model organism or to develop a cure for a human disease lectures and exercisesthe students will obtain advanced knowledge on how eukaryotic cells work at the molecular level providing them with a global view of the different layers of complexity displayed by living cells  which is necessary to understand human disease  to design disease models and to develop improved industrial cell factories
