the course has a theoretical part and an experimental part  during the experimental part the students will fabricate and characterize a working piezoresistive pressure sensor  experimental work will cover the following topics    	low pressure chemical vapor deposition  	uv lithography  	chemical wet etch  	reactive ion etch  	physical vapor deposition  	lift off  	scanning electron microscopy  	probe station based electrical device characterization  in the theoretical part  the physics  chemistry  and technology of the fabrication processes used in modern nano fabrication is described  subjects covered are    	all of the above and  	plasma enhanced cvd  	substrate materials  silicon and silica  	material modification  ion implant and doping diffusion  annealing  	bonding  anodic bonding  fusion bonding  	process integration  	process simulation  for the exam the students will present the work they have done in the cleanroom and they will present the measured data from their pressure sensors hands on instructions  lectures  e learning  exercises  and project work course material will be available after course start the overall aim of the course is to provide you with theoretical background and hands on experience in the most common experimental techniques used for silicon microfabrication  you will be introduced to microfabrication methods such as photolithography  etching  thin film deposition and characterization techniques such as sem and profilometry  during the course students will fabricate a working pressure sensor and characterize it in the dtu nanolab cleanroom  this will enable you to design a fabrication process  draw a lithographic mask and work safely in the dtu nanolab cleanroom the course is intended as the introductory hands on cleanroom based si micro  and nanofabrication course for msc students  in case of overbooking  priority will be given to physics and nanotechnology msc students
