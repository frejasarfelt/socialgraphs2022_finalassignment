theory of nonlinear oscillations  perturbation methods  averaging theory  multi scale methods  hamiltonian and lagrangian theory  dynamics on and of networks  introduction to graph network theory  applications of bifurcation theory  elements of chaos theory  elements of stochastic systems  elements of dynamic optimization lectures and group workthis course covers both theory and practical techniques to analyze simple and complex networked systems and nonlinear oscillations with engineering applications  whereas the focus in the introductory level dynamical systems course  01617  lies on the mathematical theory of local dynamics  we focus in this course on mastering the mathematical analysis applied to practical problems occurring in mathematics  physics  engineering  and life sciences  in parallel to analysing systems with both simple and complex structure  students will learn to master the analysis of dynamics characterized by periodic to aperiodic nonlinear oscillations  chaotic dynamics  and stochastic fluctuations
