the course comprises lectures  student presentations  discussions and assignments  more specifically the course will cover the following themes     background and overview of balmorel   balmorel and other models   how do we choose   equations in balmorel including slack variables   add ons   options and aggregation   boundaries   policies   data structuring   error search   input and output handling   version trackinglectures  student presentations  discussions and assignmentsin this course the students will learn how to perform analyses with the energy system model  balmorel    balmorel is a model of a national or international power system including district heating systems  it is implemented as an optimization model  mainly linear with integer elements according to options     the model is an open source model and available on a home page along with a full model description and documentation of analyses  www balmorel com   balmorel has been used for a wide range of analyses documented in project reports available on the model website and in journal papers    based on the assumption that perfect market conditions exist the model maximizes social welfare  considering operational costs  annualized investment costs and users  utility  operational costs include fuel costs  co2 quota costs as well as operation and maintenance costs  taxes  supports and other policy instruments may be included  given a number of restrictions  the model may optimize investments in new production as well as transmission capacity and the operation of plants  prices such as the electricity price can be found from the marginal values of restrictions    the model is designed to cover several countries  each country consists of one or more regions  between which electricity exchange is restricted due to limited transmission capacities  each region  in turn  consists of one or more district heating areas  between which no exchange of heat is allowed    the model considers one or more years  and the time resolution within a year may be hourly or using aggregated time segments  time series on hourly time resolution are given as input for electricity and heat demand  as well as for power production from wind  hydro and other renewable sources  during model run these series may be aggregated to lower time resolution expected workload  course participation 			80 hours preparation                        	60 hoursyou are encouraged to bring a computer with gams installed  student license for gams will be provided for the course if necessary  the course will cost 1500 dkk for phd students from eu  which covers lunch every day and dinner one evening  for other phd course participants  the course will cost 10000 dkk
