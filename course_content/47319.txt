the course focus is on the description of material properties of crystalline inorganic solids  the description of crystal structures  the concept of point defects as well as defect chemistry will be thoroughly presented to make the students able to utilize these concepts in describing the function of devices  methods of classifying materials from their electronic structures are presented as are selected elements of thermodynamics important to describe coupling phenomena such as thermoelectricity and piezoelectricity  examples of materials and preferred material models will be based on our research and development in the areas of fuel cells  advanced li ion batteries  solar cells  piezoelectric generators and thermoelectric generators  the form of the course will be lectures combined with problem solving  during the course  the students will work on their own small projects  aiming to design an  on paper  complete functional device belonging to one of the classes presented in the course  thermoelectric generators  li ion batteries  solid oxide fuel cells  solar cells and piezoelectric generators   the students will work individually or in groups on this  supervision will be provided  the purpose of these projects is to work actively with the tools and descriptions presented in the lectures lectures  problem solving  case studies and quizzes  the method of  muddiest points  and a mid term evaluation will be applied during the course for feedback to both students and teachers  solid state chemistry and its applications   2nd edition  student edition  anthony r  west  wiley  the book is available online via dtu library  hand outs this course aims at providing graduate students with an understanding of the description and application of functional materials in selected existing and emerging energy conversion devices such as solid oxide fuel cells  advanced li batteries  piezoelectric generators  thermoelectric generators and solar cells  it is the ambition to broaden the students  knowledge of materials and applied solid state chemistry and physics and to train them in utilizing their knowledge to describe the function of full devices and how to improve them this course will teach you fundamentals of the description of functional materials and will put you in a good position to work on development of energy conversion devices such as batteries  fuel cells and thermoelectric generators interested students should also consider course 47313 which supplements this course with practical exercises and focuses on possible applications
