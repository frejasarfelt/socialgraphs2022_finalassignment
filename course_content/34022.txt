the following concepts and phenomena will be discussed  	  mathematics of vector operations  cross and dot products   and operations between            vectors and scalars  the nabla     operator and the meaning of gradient  curl and            divergence 	  maxwell s equations and wave equation 	  electromagnetic  properties of materials and their connection to the optical properties  	  the free electron gas model and its improvements in modeling of real metals            where does colour arises from  why various materials have colour            what are transparent conductive oxides and why are they important  e g  in            photovoltaics  	  electric and magnetic fields boundary conditions 	  effective medium approximation and its limitations 	  propagation of the waves in various bulk and structured materials 	  basic nano fabrication techniques and their limitations 	  influence of the fabrication possibilities on the properties of the smart nanomaterialsseveral of the lectures will be in the form of group work  where the students will be able to design simple structures behaving like materials having the desired optical properties the course delivers an introduction to the basics of optics and photonics aiming to familiarise the students with the concept of light as electromagnetic waves  and its interaction with materials in the broad range of frequencies  therefore  an introduction into material properties  seen from a light matter interaction will be provided  further on we introduce the concept of smart artificial materials  metamaterials  and consider their properties and applications  we focus on the state of the art of the metamaterials and current trends in their developing  examples of metamaterials in optics and their commercialization potential will be provided   the course will also discuss the possibilities and challenges in fabrication of smart nanomaterials for the optical spectra
