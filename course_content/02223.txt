the course has three parts   1  the first part covers an introduction to embedded systems  embedded systems design challenges  introduction to systems engineering  modeling and simulation   2  the second part consists of presentations of types of embedded systems  such as  hard real time safety critical systems  e g   automotive  avionics   soft real time multimedia systems  e g   consumer electronics  smartphones   wireless sensor networks  e g   for environment monitoring  localization   multicore field programmable gate arrays  fpgas   and even labs on a chip devices   3  in the third part  the students will in small groups  do a project  which means choosing a type of computer based system and a specific application  from which you will construct a model to reason about functional and non functional requirements  and develop a simulator to evaluate implementation choices  the purpose of the project is to help the students to understand how an embedded system functions and to understand the challenges involved in the design of embedded systems in a given application context lectures  student presentations and project work  including regular supervisor meetingsmodel based systems engineering  mbse  is the formalized application of modeling to support requirements  design  analysis  verification and validation activities of engineered systems  from the initial conceptual design phase  through development and the later life cycle phases    we will focus on the initial conceptual design phase  where domain models are created and explored in order to gain knowledge of the system and its interaction with the environment  paving the way to propose a suitable solution for the design and implement of the system   we will work with challenges of designing modern embedded computer based systems  in various application technology areas  such as cyber physical systems  high performance systems  real time systems  wireless sensor networks  and biochips  lab on a chip   we will focus on using modeling and simulation to support design decisions during the systems engineering of embedded systems  you will be able to understand the impact of design choices on non functional requirements of applications  with an emphasis on performance  executing on modern embedded systems platforms  and to apply the right models and methods to analyse and design such systems
