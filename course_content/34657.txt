the course is conducted as a project where the students work as a team of integrated circuit designers that have a common task of designing a full integrated circuit  ic    the full ic contains several advanced ic blocks and each of the students is individually responsible for the design of one of them  the students will perform a state of the art literature search of their block  decide on an adequate circuit topology for the given specifications  design their block on schematic level  simulate it across global and local variations  layout the circuit  extract the parasitics  verify its post extraction performance and compare it to state of the art   the students have to collaborate with the team to find the specifications for their blocks and ensure that the blocks can interface each other   during the project  there will be status and review meeting where the students can update the team  share the challenges they are facing and help each other   there will be lectures given on advanced integrated circuit blocks  chip architecture and other selected topics individual project work  collaboration work  status and review meetings and lectures  1  t c  carusone  d a  johns   k  martin   analog integrated circuit design enable the student to design and layout an advanced integrated circuit block that is part of a full integrated circuit  ic  and to work in collaboration with other designers to ensure that the full ic operates at a system level
