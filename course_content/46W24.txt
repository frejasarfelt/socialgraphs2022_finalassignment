in this course you will run  alter and describe simple aeroelastic models of a wind turbine in a numerical framework  matlab  to couple a structural model with an unsteady aerodynamic rotor model  you will also play with and operate a basic controller and simulate the response of a wind turbine  the final grade is based on four assignments about the course content  and a video presentation on a related topic e learningthe general course objective is to learn and implement the basic models used inside a full commercial aeroelastic code for load estimations on a wind turbine  this includes a coupling between unsteady rotor aerodynamics and a dynamic structural model of the wind turbine
