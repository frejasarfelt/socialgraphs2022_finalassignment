this course uses short e lectures which can be found at dtu learn and it is expected that the students have watched relevant e lectures before each session  the e lectures provide a short introduction to the different topics and make reference to more detailed treatments in the book  or supplementary information on dtu learn   in class there will be a short introduction to the topic by the teacher  and the main activity will be group work and exercises in smaller groups and student presentations  the groups will also work with case stories that analyses biochemical and biophysical data   the course covers three areas  thermodynamics  kinetics and biophysics  in thermodynamics  we will work with selected topics in part 1 of the textbook  this includes the application of the functions enthalpy and free energy for the description of protein stability and ligand binding  in kinetics  we will work with part 2 of the textbook and introduce formal rate equations within life science  we will analyze experimental data from pharmacokinetics  enzyme kinetics and the dynamics of ligand receptor interactions  in the last part   biophysics   we study interactions between light and biomolecules  spectroscopy and microscopy  as well as the formal description of electric potentials across cell membranes e lectures  lectures  case stories  data analysis  student presentations and exercises we ue the textbook  klostermeier and rudolph  biophysical chemistry  crc press 2017  isbn 9781482252231 we will also use additional material  which will be available at our site at dtu learnin this course we will work with fundamental physical and physico chemical principles that are commonly used within life science we introduce basic theoretical frameworks for analyses of e g  protein stability  ligand binding  enzyme kinetics and biotech applications of microscopy and spectroscopy  the overarching goal is to enable the student to make practical use of these tools within a broad range of quantitative analyses in life science this course covers many  but not all  of the items discussed in the two courses 26201 and 26222  but on a less profound mathematical level  it also covers many  not all  topics from 27302
