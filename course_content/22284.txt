in the first part  we will introduce the requirements and functions of body barrier and organ tissue  physiological requirements include nutrient supply  extracellular ultrastructure  mechanical properties  and cellular signaling  functional properties may include signaling  controlled mass transport  and tissue contractility  depending on the type of tissue   the second part will cover key technologies to recapitulate the requirements and functions in vitro  this includes design principles and technologies for fluid handling  microfabrication  and materials engineering  as well as validating the critical biological properties of the engineered tissues   in the third and last part of the course  we will explore and demonstrate several 3d printing methods for engineering complex tissue models including working principles  possibilities  and limitations 4 hours per week  problem based activities  lectures  classroom discussions  exercises ratner et al   eds    biomaterials science  an introduction to materials in medicine  3rd edition  academic press 2013 high quality live laboratory models of the human body s organs and tissue barriers are increasingly needed in medicine  for example for faster drug development and accurate personalized medicine  important examples are heart  liver  kidney and bone organs as well as biological barriers in the intestine and the brain  this course will introduce you to the biological and functional requirements of barrier and organ models  jointly termed tissue models  and will equip you with the engineering principles and skills to design  manufacture  characterize  and apply advanced laboratory  in vitro  models  the main focus will on engineering advanced 3d tissue models  3d printing of soft materials has emerged as a key technology platform to achieve the required complexity for recreating key aspects of the biological functionality  and we will explore this platform in substantial detail the course was previous called  body barrier and organ modeling
