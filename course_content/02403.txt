simple methods for graphical and tabular assessments of collected or measured data  empirical distributions  histogram  normal probability plot  box plot  model formulation  model control  control of distribution function  application of especially poisson   binomial   exponential  and normal distribution  estimation and test of parameters and construction of confidence intervals in frequently occuring situations  e g  means  variances  proportions   regression analysis with one independent variable and introduction to the analysis of variance and to the analysis of contingency tables  estimation theory and simulation based methods  for all methods the focus is both on applications and on the mathematical background of the statistical methods lectures   group study and projects to give the participants an introduction to statistical thinking and methods and to provide them with an understanding of random variation and of the use of statistical models  a mathematical approach to statistics will be introduced  important statistical principles for collection and analysis of data are introduced  and methods for model choice  estimation  testing and model verification are presented  the participants learn to handle a number of elementary problems which occur frequently in engineering practice and are thus enabled to critically assess statistical  empirical  investigations and references the course is more mathematical centered version of 02402the course is a general methodological course aimed at mathematically oriented engineering students  lectures are given in danish but similar english lectures are available online
