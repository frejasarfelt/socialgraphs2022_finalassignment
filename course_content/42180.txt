the course mixes lectures on methodology with exercises and applications of the models to data on behaviour in various contexts  the methodological part introduces the microeconomic framework based on random utility maximization that is fundamental for discrete choice models  furthermore  it focuses on the most common discrete choice models  multinomial logit models and nested logit model  in addition  we also look at more advanced models and how they can enhance the realism of the modelling  the applications focus on how to apply the models to real as well as hypothetical data  the final part of the course focuses on overall and critical understanding of the methodology through application of the methods in a project lectures  discussions  theoretical and computer exercises  and a project k  e  train  2003   discrete choice methods with simulation  cambridge university press  uk  m  ben akiva and s  lerman  1985   discrete choice analysis  mit press  cambridge massachusettsthe course introduces a powerful method for market and demand analysis  the main objective is to make students capable of using discrete choice models to analyse choice behaviour  e g  in transportation or energy systems  this includes how to conceptualise behaviour using a mathematical model  analyse behavioural data  and statistical modelling that can be used for forecasting and market analysis
