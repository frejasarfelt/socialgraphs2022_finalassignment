the course is based on lectures and computer exercises to explain the development and validation of predictive food microbiology models  the students use this information in their project work to develop and or evaluate a predictive microbiology model for a selected microorganism food combination  this course allow students to predict microbial responses in food including effects of processing  product characteristics and conditions of storage and distribution to consumers  mathematical models to predict growth or inactivation and the effect of constant or dynamic product characteristics and storage conditions are presented  predictive models for the growth boundary of human pathogens are described together with their application for development of new food products and recipes  software for development and application of deterministic and stochastic predictive models are presented in relation to assessment and management of microbial food quality and safety  the use of predictive food microbiology models to evaluate food losses in distribution chains is introduced lectures  group work exercises  project workthis course provides the students with an overview of the quantitative microbial ecology of food and detailed insight in the development  validation and application of predictive food microbiology models  the aim is to enable students to understand the potential of predictive food microbiology models for new product development  assessment and documentation food safety and quality as well as evaluation of food losses in distribution chains
