first and second order optimalitty conditions  kkt conditions  active set and interior point algorithms for linear programming  lp  and convex quadratic programming  qp     methods for nonlinear programming  nlp   sequential quadratic programming  sqp  algorithms and augmented lagrange algorithms   development of simple numerical algorithms and use of existing  software libraries for constrained optimization   lp  qp  nlp   apply convex optimization  socp  sdp   optimization of dynamic systems and optimal control  application examples  from engineering and finance lectures and project work when modelling a technical or economical problem it often happens that free parameters are determined by the solution to an optimization problem subject to some constraints on the solution   the simplest example is that the parameters must be positive or lie in certain intervals due to   physical constraints in the underlying physical problem  in this course the participant learns about efficient algorithms for constrained optimization   the student will be able both to develop algorithms and to use existing software for numerical solution of optimization problems with constraints  the course concerns numerical algorithms for linear programming  lp   convex quadratic programming  qp   convex optimization  and non linear programming  nlp  the course may be followed by 02619  model predictive control   and a master thesis project
