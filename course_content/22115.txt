brief introduction to evolutionary theory and population genetics  mechanisms of molecular evolution  models of dna and protein substitution  reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using distance based methods  parsimony  maximum likelihood  and bayesian techniques  advanced models of nucleotide substitution  gamma distributed mutation rates  molecular clock models  codon models and analysis of selective pressure   statistical analysis of biological hypotheses  likelihood ratio tests  bootstrapping  aic  bayesian statistics    the student will acquire practical experience in the use of computational methods by analyzing sequences from the scientific literature online lectures  computer exercises  handout exercises  note  the course is run as a  flipped classroom   i e   lectures are viewed online before class to provide the student with broad knowledge in the field of molecular evolution  i e  the evolution of dna  rna  and proteins   it is in particular the aim to provide the student with experience and in depth knowledge of model based methods for phylogenetic tree reconstruction and hypothesis testing in an evolutionary context  although the study of molecular evolution does require a certain level of mathematical understanding  this course has been designed to attract a diverse range of students
