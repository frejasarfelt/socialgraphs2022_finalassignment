the course will start with a consideration of corrosion related degradation of metallic materials  but will also consider degradation of polymers   the course is divided into theoretical and practical parts  in which the practicals demonstrate and allow application of the theory learned   the course will start by considering the thermodynamics of corrosion and will consider polarization phenomena  including principles for the estimation of corrosion rates  the course will consider various forms of corrosion  including combined corrosion and mechanical factors  wear  fatigue  etc  that can cause accelerated degradation of materials  during the course  emphasis will be placed on the choice of solutions that can eliminate or reduce corrosion and material degradation  and importance in relation to sustainability  in connection with the practical part of the course  training in the application of software to make thermodynamic calculations  as well as literature searches and identification of relevant standards  will be given  in connection with the practical part of the course it will be possible to used advanced equipment to characterize the corrosion of materials in selected environments lectures  tutorials and 5 reports the aims of the course are to educate people with a theoretical and practical knowledge of corrosion and corrosion related degradation of materials  mainly metals  and to relate how corrosion is an important aspect in relation to sustainable use of materials and products  the course is multidisciplinary  combining metallurgy  electrochemistry and general materials degradation  corrosion  wear  fatigue etc   the course will enable the student  on the basis of both a theoretical foundation and practical and analytical abilities  to choose materials solutions to corrosion related materials degradation problems  mostly in metals but also for polymers  emphasis will be placed on the students  ability to combine theory and practical knowledge and to be able to produce realistic materials selection solutions
