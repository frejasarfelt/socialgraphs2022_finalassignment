the course is targeted to phd students who aim to apply life cycle assessment to specific waste technologies or waste management systems for systematic evaluation of their environmental performances  the course includes an introduction to lca modelling of waste technologies and energy systems as well as exercises involving building and assessing an integrated waste management system with the lca software easetech  introductory lectures are provided in relation to  lca principles  waste generation and composition  source segregation  collection  material recovery recycling  bio treatments  composting  digestion   landfilling  thermal treatment  management of residuals  e g  use on land  combustion   material  substance  energy flow analysis  life cycle inventory data  data uncertainties  and interpretation of results  students apply the introduced concepts in a range of exercises leading to a full lca scenario of an integrated waste management system  an understanding of the importance of sensitivity and uncertainty assessment will also be a part of the course  after the course  an extended abstract is submitted summarizing the lca modelling of a selected system or technology lectures  exercises  and assignment work  60 hours of reading  articles  book chapters  documentation and technical documents   and submission of a written assignment waste management is an important part of everyday life  the environmental impacts from waste management also carry a significant load if not carried out properly  and it is important to be able to quantify how big the impact from this sector is  waste life cycle assessment is considered as one of the most effective tools for getting a better understanding of the environmental aspects originating from the waste management sector    the aim is to provide to the participant necessary skills and expertise to perform a life cycle assessment of a waste management system  this will include an analysis of the technical system  its impact assessment and overall evaluation  the aim of this course is also to demonstrate the importance of sensitivity analysis and communication of results within the framework of the easetech model this course introduces and applies the waste lca model easetech developed at the technical university of denmark in collaboration with highly acknowledged scientists in waste management and in lca methodology
