experiments are carried out in the hydraulic laboratory  bldg  114   a number of different exercises are considered  e g         impact of a jet       flow around and forces on vertical piles       flow over under and forces on a weir sluice gate       pipe flow  flow through cooling water intake   a great deal of autonomy is required in carrying out experiments in order to obtain a feel for the dynamics of the water flows preparation of a program and a report under supervisionto introduce students to the more practical hydraulic engineering and hydrodynamics  partly by carrying out experiments in a current flume  partly by calculating the flow theoretically and comparing with own measurements the course is primarily aimed at students who have followed the recommended prerequisites in the previous semester
