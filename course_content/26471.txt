the organic chemistry is taught with basis in modern mechanistic concepts  the students are trained in the iupac nomenclature  the functional groups in organic chemistry are treated systematically  the stereo chemistry is treated in detail  the students are introduced to the chemistry of carbocations and carbanions  also introduced is the chemistry of carbohydrates  proteins and lipids  the spectroscopic methods  i e  ms  nmr and ir  are presented and the students are trained in using these methods in identification of organic compounds the purpose of the course is to familiarize the students with organic chemistry to the extent that enables them to apply the concepts of organic chemistry to problems encountered in biochemistry and biological chemistry  to provide the necessary background for using the organic chemistry literature on a sound scientific background from 2023 this course is only offered in the spring semester
