in the course students will work on design and production of a specific micro mechanical device  the device will be based on polymers and or metal materials  the corresponding manufacturing technologies include micro injection moulding  hot embossing of micro structures  cnc milling  micro electrical discharge machining  electroforming  additive manufacturing  joining  and assembly at micro scale  the starting point is a set of functional requirements for the device  the students have to transform these requirements into technical specifications  technical drawings and working prototypes  the realization of the prototypes involves hand on work with selected micro manufacturing processes suitable for industry 4 0 project work in the 3 weeks period  the students will be grouped into teams of  experts  that will have to work together to fulfil the project goals the students will work hands on with the complete product development of a specific device  from clarification of requirements and technology possibilities to manufacturing and testing of prototypes  the final aim is the production of some working prototypes along with a full product description including tolerancing  material selection and production related information   after the project the students will be able to  a  describe and apply methodologies for developing specific micro mechanical components to a prototype level b  evaluate and choose micro manufacturing processes for specific components c  propose technical solutions to manufacturing problems d  present in a professional way their final proposition and prototypes e  understand the complete product development process  emphasizing on collaboration  project management and integrationthe course content will partly be linked to the activities at camm   centre for acoustic mechanical micro systems  www camm elektro dtu dk
