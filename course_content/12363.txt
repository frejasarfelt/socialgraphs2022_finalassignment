general hands on experience using standard and advanced levels of ida ice  load calculations in ida ice  approach for simulation of indoor environment and building energy  mathematical modelling approach used by ida ice  zone divisions  controllers etc    version handling system and the  parametric runs  tool in ida ice  tools for quick and easy parameter variations and optimisations   macros and advanced controls  output files and logging of variables  analysis of results lectures  exercises and group workto introduce to the student simulations of indoor environment and energy consumption of systems and buildings in ida ice  to enable the student to design and assign systems to a building geometry  and specify customized controls of hvac systems  to evaluate the modelling approach and simulation output and understand the working principles of building energy simulation programs and in particular of ida ice  the course enables the participants to use advanced tools for building performance simulation the course targets civil engineering students at master level that are interested in the use of advanced  state of the art methodologies and programs to simulate the consequences for indoor environment and building energy consumption of decisions made at the design stage  however  the course may also be followed by bsc or phd students with the required basic knowledge that are interested in learning how to use the advanced levels of ida ice   the course relies on students bringing their own pc  the programs used in the course requires a windows based pc  students using mac computers can use boot camp to install a windows partition on their computer  students at dtu can for free download and install windows via microsoft dreamspark  for more information follow the link https   www campusnet dtu dk cnnet software  you need a dtu login to open the link
