the 1st and the 2nd laws of thermodynamics  a more thorough introduction to the concept of entropy than is normally seen at introductory courses on thermodynamics  assessment of popular descriptions of entropy as disorder  scattering  information and the arrow of time  exergy as a measure of energy quality  exergy consumption in physical processes  exergy consumption in chemical processes  exergy analysis of selected systems such as cooling machines  engines  fuel cells  chemical industry and electricity production study in groups based on textbook and notes  ca  four modules with teacher  the course will be subject to evaluation during the course periodtextbook  tadeusz j kotas  the exergy method of thermal plant analysis  exergon publishing company  london 2012  the previous version  1985  is available online free of charge at sciencedirect com  it is ok to use that version efficient handling of energy becomes increasingly important whether we choose to base the future energy system on renewable energy  or we continue to consume the fossil reserves  the 1st law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved and can neither be created  nor consumed  so why do we have problems with energy  it is typically the usable part of the energy that is decisive and of interest in energy analyses  so why not put it into system by the term exergy  the student will understand the concept of exergy and will be able to apply it to different subprocesses which can be combined into more complex systems  the course will also provide a better understanding of reversibility  entropy and sustainability in our energy systems as well as in a broader sense energy cannot vanish  but where does it then go when used  how can you get the most out of your energy
