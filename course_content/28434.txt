the course is divided into four main modules  1 basics and principles  operation modes in membrane operations  membrane modules  membrane materials  mathematical models for porous and nonporous membranes  concentration polarization and fouling  models to describe fouling  technical evaluation of different membrane processes compared to traditional separation processes  main applications of membrane technology  2 liquid operations   reverse osmosis  nanofiltration  ultrafiltration and microfiltration  application of the basic principles to liquid operations   3 gas and special operations  gas separation  pervaporation  membrane contactors  membrane distillation  electrodialysis  membrane bioreactors   4 particular applications of membrane technology  membranes in biotechnology  membranes in the chemical industry  membranes in the food industry  membranes used as reactors  membranes in wastewater treatment lectures and problem solving in groups to enable the students to understand the mechanisms for solute transport in different membrane types and to estimate the possibilities to use separation processes based on the application of semipermeable membranes scientific papers will be used as course material  the papers will be provided by the teacher  the needed books are open access  free  for dtu students as the course is online  the students must have a proper computer  cam is also mandatory
