the course uses the textbook  biophysical chemistry by klostermeier and rudolph  crc press 2017   we will focus on the  methods  section  part iv  of the book  but make frequent references to other areas on the structure and function of proteins  the course includes a fundamental and practical introduction to spectroscopy  thermodynamics  kinetics  scattering and computational analyses that underlies the methods  the course covers a wide range of areas in protein science  including protein structure and folding  protein protein and protein ligand interactions and proteome analysis lectures  e lectures  exercises  data analysis and computer experiments biophysical chemistry   d  klostermeier   m g  rudolph  ed  1   2017  the e book can be downloaded from dtu s library  other material will be available on dtu learn the course provides a broad introduction to molecular protein science with focus on methods used to characterize the structure  stability and interactions of proteins  we will work with the theoretical underpinnings of the measuring principles  application of the methods and critical assessment of the results  this will include a thorough discussion and evaluation of the forces and mechanisms that stabilize protein conformations and protein ligand complexes  the course will present a modern view into how method selection is performed in protein science  the student  will also learn how analysis of collected data drives the decision making process forward  towards the next step in a research project the course will start in the fall semester 2023
