with onset in microbial metabolites especially fungal  the course will focus on the following topics  a  the biochemistry of the chemodiversity in microorganisms including the biosynthesis of important classes of compounds such as polyketides  terpenoids and alkaloids  b  concept and strategies of metabolite profiling and metabolomics  c  the core analytical methodologies used for detection and analysis of natural products including lc and gc and detectors e g  uv  diode array detection   fluorescence  evaporative light scattering and especially mass spectrometry  ms   d  data analysis of unit resolution ms and high resolution  tof  ms atmospheric pressure ionization spectra  e  data interpretation for database searching  f  tentative identification of compounds based on lc ms data  logd consideration and ion exchange sample preparation strategy  and g  target analysis of known compounds and their metabolites based on lc ms ms  triple quadrupole data  including the scan functions of this instrument  h  solid phase extraction  spe  purification strategies  if possible we encourage and facilitate that the students work on their own data during the course  microbial genome sequence and natural product containing extracts   please contact us beforehand to arrange this lectures  seminars  group discussions and exercisesmicroorganisms are unique sources for diverse chemistry that can be exploited in biotechnology  e g  as pharmaceuticals  or feared as contaminants in food or feed  e g  mycotoxins   the aim of the course is to give the students a fundamental insight into this chemical diversity produced by microorganisms and how they are analyzed  more specifically the course will introduce i  how the various types of natural products are biosynthesized  ii  the different types of unique enzymes that catalyzes their biosynthesis  iii  the nature of the underlying gene clusters  iv  how bioinformatics tools can be used to link genes to chemical structures and vice versa  v  and the analytical methods and strategies to profile  characterize and quantitate such metabolites the course is running every second year   next time in january 2023 course fee 1  the course is free for all phd students from denmark and other eu eea countries  however  the participant will have to pay a fee for the actual expenses  course materials  drinks etc    2  dkk 12 500 for participants from industry
