global  contemporary methods such as morris screening  regression based sensitivity  sobol s indices  monte carlo  bayesian inference  etc  as well as local  classical methods such as derivative based sensitivity  first order error propagation  etc  methods for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis will be covered during the course   the course aims at giving hands on experience with the topics studied  i e  the student will learn how to apply a method and how to interpret the results generated by this method  therefore  lectures about the theory will be followed by exercise sessions where the methods explained in the lectures can be applied in one of our computer rooms  examples are taken from the textbook  from the literature and from ongoing research work at process systems engineering  pse  at dtu chemical engineering about one week of teaching and computer exercises  followed by two or more weeks where the methods are applied to the student s own model or system  lectures will typically take place in the morning  and will be followed by practical sessions in the afternoon  later on  students are to apply the methods to a model system agreed between student and teachers  as a case study format   the evaluation is based on the submission of a final report about the case study  including matlab code  textbook  saltelli a  ratto m  andres t  campolongo f  cariboni j  gatelli d  saisana m  tarantola s  global sensitivity analysis  the primer  west sussex  england  john wiley   sons  2008  gelman  carlin  stern and rubin  bayesian data analysis   2nd ed  chapman   hall  crc  2004 modeling is actively used in various scientific and engineering disciplines for a variety of ends  from development of process understanding to design  control and operation of  natural or man made  systems   most numerical models simulating such systems tend to be complex with many parameters  state variables and non linear relations resulting in many degrees of freedom  using a fine tuning method  manually or statistically   these models can be made to produce virtually any desired behavior to fit the observations about the system in question  what is challenging  however  is to ascertain a degree of reliability and credibility of the models before one applies them in reality   it is precisely the objective of this course to introduce students to modern techniques of model analysis  uncertainty and sensitivity    the primary aim of this course is therefore to make the student able to analyze the uncertainty and sensitivity of models in the matlab  computing and simulation environment  global  contemporary  as well as local  classical  methods for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis will be covered during the course knowledge of matlab at the start of the course is an advantage  but not a requirement  assuming that you have access to matlab  an introduction to matlab with exercises can be sent to you a couple of weeks before the start of the course
