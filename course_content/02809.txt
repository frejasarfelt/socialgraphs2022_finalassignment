the course is focused on development of functional ux design prototypes that combine multiple mobile devices and interfaces  from flat ui to dialog and voice based design patterns   it uses lean methods based on pain driven design  hierarchical user story mapping  multidevice design patterns and microinteractions system design  as well as rapid prototyping combining both industry proven and novel tools and methods   the course provides students with a systematic foundation and practical experience in designing ux prototype designs  which can also later be applied to  next generation  interfaces in other domains  subsequently addressed in 02266  user experience engineering  lectures combined with practical exercises and project workthe objective of the course is to enable students 1  to apply lean prototyping methods for ux design of personalized user interfaces  and 2  to select appropriate tools  methods and designs for the tasks at hand the course is part of dtu compute s digital innovation canon
