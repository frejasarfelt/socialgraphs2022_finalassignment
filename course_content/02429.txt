the course will cover basic theory and application of mixed linear models  this includes fixed and random effects but also more general correlation structures relevant to the analysis of repeated measurements longitudinal data   in short  the course gives theoretical and practical tools for performing statistical analysis of data structures which do not satisfy the independence assumptions made in introductory statistics courses    the statistical software r will be used the course will run in a  flipped classroom like  manner  lectures are given as online podcasts which must be watched before the teaching modules  all course material is available online  during the face to face teaching modules students will typically work on computer exercises  mostly practical data analysis challenges  the format will depend on the number of students participating  but student involvement is to be expected  in the autumn 2022 standard lectures will be held though link to online course notes  https   02429 compute dtu dk ebookto obtain knowledge about and ability to perform statistical analysis of data using mixed linear models with applications in agriculture  food science  biology  medicine  and technical sciences
