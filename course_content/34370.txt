the course stems from our research activities and participation in external industrial projects  with the aim to bridge between traditional networking and new  emerging  cloud based mechanisms and technologies that are reshaping networking and the evolution of network services and applications   after an initial introduction to the concept and physical components of  the cloud  in the initial lecture  the course shifts to enabling switching and network virtualization technologies in the second lecture   after these  a new block of lectures  hands on  try to provide the fundamental understanding of  software  enablers for virtualized setups based on isolation in the linux o s  later on  hypervisor based host virtualization is introduced and hands on networking within a hypervisor based virtualization environment is set in focus  the concept of network function virtualization is introduced next  to link the previous technological evolution to the evolution of telecommunication services and new telecommunication architectures  after that  isolation  versus hypervisor based virtualization  is revisited  together with container technology as a new paradigm for service composition and deployment  microservices   container networking models are presented in this context  afterwards the  catle  approach to container management is introduced  together with container orchestrators  i e  docker swarm  vs  kubernetes  and examples of networking within them demonstrated  the course closes with a block related to automation needs and technologies in cloud network environments  and the emerging idea  2019  of cloud native design to qualify the student for the analysis and design of networks in cloud and cloud native environments  with focus on the underlying technologies and mechanisms the course is based on hands on examples and practical software setups during the lectures   it is therefore expected that participants bring to the lectures their own laptop  with min  8gb ram and 100gb free space in hd      the course is suitable as part of a phd study plan  no hard prerequisite is assumed  except basic tcp ip understanding
