in the first week the students are trained in metallographic methods  e g  use of light optical microscopy and sample preparation  electron microscopy and chemical element analysis  with these methods  exercises in phase diagrams  phase transformations  heat treatment  strengthening  deformation and mechanical failure are carried out  additional project work in small groups on a self selected topic is included under supervision of a materials researcher laboratory workto supplement the theory from basic materials science  41650 41657 41659 41681 41680  to enable the students to carry out micro  and macroscopic investigations of metallic materials and identify the microstructure of metals that have been subjected to a combination of processes  casting  rolling  forming  joining  heat treatment   evaluation of the results in terms of the relationship between processing  microstructure and properties in 2023 the course is only offered in june  herefter the course will again be offered in both janaury and june the laboratory course has been part of 41652 until f12  therefore  it is not applicable for students who attended 41652
