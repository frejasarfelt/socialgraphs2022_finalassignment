each week is structured into subsections  in the beginning of the week we will discuss the required material for the week in class and you will complete practical electronic laboratory exercises and problem sets to cement your understanding lectures with problem sets and practical laboratory exercises  journal club style presentations   neil storey   electronics  a systems approach  published by pearson education uk  6th edition  july 20  2017    meyya meyyappa   the nanotechnology measurement handbook 1st edition  published by keithley instruments ltd it is almost certain that at some point in a physics career you will have to perform measurements using electronic equipment  it is my goal to give you an introduction to the tools and techniques you will need to not just get great quality data  but understand  redesign  and troubleshoot such electrical measurement systems  some of the most challenging measurements you can make will be of novel nanoelectronic devices  so we will focus on these   they can be exquisitely sensitive and very precious  especially if you are the one that has made them    through lectures  problem sets and laboratory practical work  you will gain an understanding of how to minimise noise  maximise signals and eliminate common sources of measurement error and device failure in these very sensitive systems  after completing the course  you will be able to critically analyse and discuss how electrical measurement systems for nanomaterials devices are put together and how techniques are applied  as well as design your own measurement set ups  surpassing common  black box  approaches   in this new course  we will be working closely together to shape the content to be most beneficial to you in your future career  be that in research or in industry
