the course consists of lectures on topics such as the magnetism of permanent magnets and soft ferromagnets  fe  gd  ni    and their interaction  but also more advanced topics such as the demagnetization tensor field and small homogeneously magnetized objects  during the course the student will learn to design a configuration of permanent magnets that can produce a given desired magnetic field  to do this  we will use a modelling tool  specifically matlab and an associated framework  magtense  that can calculate the magnetic field from simple magnetic building blocks  with the help of these tools we will investigate how to create different magnetic fields  the student will afterwards experimentally realize a permanent magnet configuration of own design using simple magnets as building blocks and  finally  experimentally measure the magnetic field that this produces  here we will use 3d printers to print the scaffolding for the magnetic building blocks lectures  problem solving and project workthe course content is covered by lecture notes provided by the teachers  scientific papers and freely available opensource matlab code developed by the teachers the aim of the course is to give the students a broad knowledge of permanent magnets and ferromagnetic materials  this includes the use of permanent magnets in industrial applications  the magnetic field generated by permanent magnet systems and how to model such systems  the students will use this knowledge to design and optimize their own permanent magnet configuration and realize it experimentally with simple building blocks and verify their model the course will give you direct experience in permanent magnets that are used in multiple technologies and industrial processes  you will understand the magnetic field created by permanent magnets and will also get to design  create and play with your own complex structure of permanent magnets and 3d printed scaffold
