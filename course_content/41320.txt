derivation of the continuity equation  the navier stokes equation and the energy equation on differential form  tensor notation for describing flow kinematics  analogies between transfer of momentum  heat and mass  flow in ducts  boundary layers  free shear flows  creeping stokes flows  potential flows  similarity solutions and vorticity formulation of the navier stokes equation  linear instability analysis and laminar to turbulent transition  theory will also be discussed in relation to industrial problems lectures and problem solving  feedback on exercises during the course to develop an analytical and physical understanding of the fundamental equations that govern fluid flow and solve them analytically in reduced form in a range of engineering and academic problems  the assumptions in the reduced forms of the equations and their implications on the obtained solutions will be carefully discussed and evaluated  the student will apply the solutions of the reduced equation on relevant engineering problems and evaluate the validity of the solutions based on the respective assumptions made
