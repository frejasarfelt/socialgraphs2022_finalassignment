introduction to high performance computers  emphasizing those aspects that are important in connection with numerical computations for larger problems  parallel computers and gpus  architecture and network  with an emphasis on multi core and smp computers   parallel programming using openmp lectures  computer exercises and computer projects cost effective multi core computers  and the usage of gpus  enable researchers to carry out complex computations on commodity hardware   however  only a few applications exploit the potential processing power  due to the lack of knowledge and understanding  how to write and implement efficient programs and workflows on computers with modern architectures  making use of high performance computing  hpc  technology   this course enables the students to work with computational problems from scientific computing and related areas  and their efficient and well performing implementation   the course provides an introduction to the skills needed to utilize high performance computing methods  and the application and deployment on modern hardware  from a single cpu core to a gpu  and from a laptop to larger hpc installations programming and implementation of c c   code  as well as using the linux command line  is an essential part of the course  and thus we advise to have followed course 02635  or an equivalent course  before taking this course   contact the responsible course teacher about the prerequisites  if you are in doubt  the course material consists of notes handed out by the lecturers  the course is aimed at students from all master programs   in the case of over subscription of the course  first priority is given to students from the study programs listed under  course type  above    this course is a prerequisite for the course 02616 large scale modeling
