the course provides a multi disciplinary approach to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacterial pathogens to understand the emerging global threat    the course will focus on the theoretical background of development of antimicrobials  as well as the  modes of action  mechanisms  classification  epidemiology  treatment  usage  mobile elements  bacterial physiology and acquisition of resistance  methodologies in antimicrobial susceptibility testing and interpretation of phenotypic susceptibility data   the course will give hands on laboratory experience in both conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole genome sequencing technology of single bacterial isolates  further  introduce bioinformatics analysis to determine antimicrobial resistance in bacteria and to characterize bacterial genomes in a one health context approx  40  lectures  both traditional lecturing and e learning   30  hands on laboratory work  antimicrobial susceptibility testing and sequencing   30  project based bioinformatic group work on case studiestextbook  antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from livestock and companion animals  schwarz  cavaco and shen  asm  isbn 9781555819798   coursera courses  antimicrobial resistance   theory and methods  whole genome sequencing of bacterial genomes   tools and applicationsthe course provides a multi disciplinary approach combining the disciplines of conventional microbiology  whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics to determine antimicrobial resistance in bacteria  antibiotic resistance will be evaluated both pheno  and geno typically  and bioinformatics software will be applied to further characterize bacterial genomes in relation to development and transmission of antimicrobial resistance    the student will upon completion of the course i  be able to perform phenotypically antimicrobial susceptibility testing  ii  be able to perform whole genome sequencing of dna from bacteria  iii  be able to conduct bioinformatics analyses to determine the taxonomic identity  as well as presence of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes  and iv  be able to interpret the analytic results with the purpose to explain concerns and actions up to 15 places are reserved for danida fellows it is mandatory to participate in the laboratory activities
