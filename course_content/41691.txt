the course will provide lectures on the fundamentals of x ray diffraction  kinematical scattering theory  and an introduction to common methods for microstructure analysis as quantification of crystallographic texture  evaluation of internal stresses and strains and line profile analysis  by self study the ph d  student will further deepen the general knowledge about the different techniques with focus on a chosen special application  the ph d  students will present and discuss results of measurements with laboratory equipment or from synchrotron experiments based on literature or own data introductory lectures  self study  assignments and presentationthe phd student should obtain theoretical knowledge on the possibilities and limitations of x ray diffraction for the purpose of microstructure characterization  phase analysis  texture analysis  stress analysis and line profile analysis  and apply this knowledge to particular problems in applied materials science and engineering
