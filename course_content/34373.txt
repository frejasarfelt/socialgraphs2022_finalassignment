the purpose of this course is to introduce the student to advanced methods of developing firmware on arm cortex mcus for iot purposes  in particular  focus will be on setting up the mcu  for example configuring the gpios  uart  interrupts and timers  spi and i2c communication and analog digital  adc dac  functionality   the  arduino free  bare metal approach to microcontroller firmware development will provide the student with an understanding of the capabilities of an embedded system for internet of things  the student will be able to set up a real time operating system  rtos  environment and run multiple threads in the arm processor   the course is structured around lectures and exercises where the student will gain hands on experience within mcu firmware programming  during the exercises  the student will learn to configure uart spi or i2c peripherals to communicate with analog sensors or digital sensors   modules  the course will have a focus on iot such that low power communication  e g  lpwan communication technologies  lora lorawan  sigfox  ble and nbiot lte m  and ble will be utilized for wireless data transmission during the course  during the course  the students will be planning and developing their own projects in groups and evaluated from a report  the course will run the first time in the spring of 2022  course keywords  embedded systems  low power embedded firmware development for iot  bare metal programming  stm32  nucleo  bluepill  cubeide  freertos  tasks and semaphores  no arduino this course will focus on embedded hardware development for low power internet of things  iot  using embedded c   bare metal firmware programming  the purpose of this course is to introduce the student to advanced methods of developing firmware on arm cortex microcontrollers  mcus  for iot purposes  the student will be working with low level mcu configuration and firmware development to enable communication with iot relevant technologies such as lora lorawan  sigfox  ble and nbiot lte m as well as digital and analog sensors  the arduino ide will not be used in this course
