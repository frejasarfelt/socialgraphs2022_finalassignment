introduction to basic problems of digital communication  deterministic signals  application of stochastic processes in the description of signals and noise  sampling and quantization of continuous stochastic signals  examples of user signals  eg  sound and images  linear estimation and prediction  baseband transmission of digital signals  optimal receivers  signal design  and line codes  models for physical transmission channels  radio channels  optical channels and storage media  as awgn and mimo channels  modulation techniques  amplitude modulation  quadrature modulation  digital phase modulation  and ofdm  simple protocols for information exchange lectures  problem work and simulation exercises under supervision  with use of matlab   mandatory assignmentsto provide tools for the students to analyse and develop modern systems with digital transmission  emphasis is put into description of signals and noise as stochastic processes and in conversion of continuous analog signals to digital form  models are provided for different transmission channels and the signal processing in some basic transmission systems is analysed  it is the aim of the course to give both an theoretical analysis of the systems and a demonstration of implementations of the signal processing to facilitate simulation of performance
