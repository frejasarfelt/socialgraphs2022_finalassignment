introduction to the structural use of glass  architectural aspects on the use of glass in buildings  properties of glass  production and structure  laminated glass  toughened glass  typical mechanical properties  specifications  safety  structural design  plates  beams  cable supported structures  fins  shells and membranes  norms and standards  structural connections  adhesive joints and bolted connections lectures  project work the overall goal is to make the student capable of designing simple load carrying structures in glass  this requires a basic knowledge about the structural properties of glass  further  to be able to determine experimentally the basic mechanical properties of glass and to specify these in structural design  finally  the students are given knowledge about standard and advanced methods for structural analysis applicable to structures in glass or to structures where glass elements are a significant part of the load carrying structure
