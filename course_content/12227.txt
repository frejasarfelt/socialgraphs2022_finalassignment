with respect to air pollution sources  transportation of air pollutants and atmospheric conversions  these topics will be presented on an advanced level that is relevant for understanding regional and global air pollution effects  these effects includes deposition of airborne pollutants in ecosystems  plant uptake  acidification and eutrophication of terrestrial ecosystems  plant food security and production  biological monitoring  formation of greenhouse gasses  interaction with environmental parameters  climate change and ecosystem response feedback to the atmosphere  effects on ozone layer depletion and air pollution and climate change interaction effects  a mandatory practical exercise is included  laboratory experiment with plant air pollution exposure  ozone  lectures  theoretical and practical exercisespresentations chapters from different books articles  primary and review  notes  manuals for practical exercise the goal of the course is that the student obtains a scientific understanding of the fate of anthropogenic emissions to the atmosphere and its effects on the regional and global scale  there will be focus on climatic  biological  and ecosystem effects  the effects will be evaluated with respect to global variation of air pollutants and ecosystem types  air pollution effects will also be evaluated in combination with the environment such as climatic parameters  climate change and ultraviolet radiation  there will also be emphasis on the current knowledge level and how these results have been obtained in highly controlled laboratory experiments and in less controlled field based manipulation experiments advanced course  technological specialisation course
