the course comprises a project regarding the design of a realistic powerdistribution system  this may be done by analysing and  a realistic case  this may be done in cooperation with an external industry partner  it is not a requirement that the case is an actual case  just that the case could exist   possible topics may be  but not limited to    specifications and analysis of specifications selection of design principles evaluation and selection of methods selection of system and components analysis at varying load scenaries  e g  loadflow  fault analysis system optimisation  the project must cover several technical areas  the project is completed by group work the project is evaluated via documentation and presentationgroupbased projectwork with supervision  group size is 3 5 students  one person groups are not accepted without special permission from study leader the overall goal of the course is that the students can demonstrate competance in selection and use of techniques  that is either learned through lectures or through independant work under supervision from a supervisor   as a part of the projekt a larger electrical distribution system is analysed in ordet to select and use learned techniques and methods  which the students has aquired during the first 4 semesters  it is required that the student studies the use of powerfactory and use this program as one of several calculation tools or methods  the system is analysed using group work  which starts in the 13 week period and is completed in the three week period in june   the project work documented by a reportnote that the program powerfactory is an important part of the course  the program is made avalible by the department  there will not be computers at the department with the program installed  the program will only run on windows computers  or mac computers booted in windows   the program may be used from home is the university vpn is activated
