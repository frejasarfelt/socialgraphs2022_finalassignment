the course is an extension of previous competencies acquired in introductory courses  the course presupposes the fundamental knowledge of building  construction  installation  materials  and energy   design  the course builds on digital building information models and objects used in a project with greater complexity  this building model is prepared for data exchange in accordance with various requirements specifications  the course provides an understanding of danish and international guidelines and standards used in construction for the exchange of data  as well as knowledge of classification systems  model consistency  model control  collision control  and rule based control systems are investigated and used in the project lectures  individual assignments  and group assignments the course expands the participants  understanding of building information modeling  bim   the course works with the basic information objects that together create bim  the starting point is open bim formats where the basic model can be manipulated freely  subsequently  further complexities are incorporated in bim  where both interdisciplinary and synchronous manipulations must be handled  the course focuses on being able to produce a building model basis and benefit from other people s information  during the course  linked and coupled objects  including parametric and dependent variables  are investigated  the course is designed to gain a deeper knowledge of methods  standards  and tools  where bim is included  along the way  knowledge of visual programming tools used for computational design   engineering is gained the course is a superstructure of 11000 11900 and is reserved for the bachelor s course in  building design   the course is included in connection with material exchange to   with parallel and follow up courses  11052  11034  11080 and 11337
