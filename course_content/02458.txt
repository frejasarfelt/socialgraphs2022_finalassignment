models of cognitive processes are introduced through lectures  through exercises  students learn to test models  investigate model variations and simulate data  finally  the students learn to independently use the methods to analyse and compare models during project work lectures  exercises and project workto be announcedtheories of cognition as information processing can be implemented in quantitative models  in this course  we introduce models of attention  memory and perception  we extract commonalities and discuss model variations  the students will learn to evaluate models based on empirical and simulated data using mathematical analysis programs
