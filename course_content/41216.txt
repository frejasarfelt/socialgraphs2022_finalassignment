the main emphasis is on the determination of the global response of a given ship sailing in waves  safety against global failure of the hull girder should be evaluated under normal operation conditions  accidental loads  collision and grounding  will also be covered as well as rational rule development   bending moment  sagging  hogging  ocean waves  linear and non linear wave elevation  regular and irregular waves  excitation wave spectrum  stationary process  wave scatter diagram  stresses in the hull girder  midship section  effective thickness  section modulus  maximum normal stress  yield stress  statistical short term and long term analyses  extreme values  expected fatigue damage  hull vibrations  hull flexibility  the natural frequency of the hull  springing  whipping  reliability analysis of the hull girder  hasofer lind safety index  probability of failure  limit state function lecture modules and project work j j jensen 2001  load and global response of ships  elsevier science to enable the students to understand and to use modern rational methods within the strength of materials and reliability theory to design ships   to enable students to do quality assurance of an engineering project the students have the possibility to continue working on a ship project initiated in the course 41271 ship design
