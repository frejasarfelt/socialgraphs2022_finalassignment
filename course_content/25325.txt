we will start from the physical processes regulating the climate and their variability from geological to annual time scales  next  we will introduce how ocean biogeochemistry regulates climate and is being altered in modern times  how the ecosystem and food web are effected by increasing temperature and partial pressure of co2  and how these effects influence the major ecosystem services  e g  carbon sequestration  provided by the ocean  finally  we will introduce the students to the available technology for observing and predicting the effects of climate change  and to the societal efforts and costs for mitigating its effects  the course will consist of lectures and exercises highlighting the mechanisms and interactions between climate and ocean ecosystems and guest lectures focusing on up to date climate research  the course will draw on multiple examples related to sustainable development goals  particularly with regards  14  life below water   and  13  climate action   the course includes a student debate on climate issues  weekly climate updates and a focus on communicating climate change to a broad audience lectures  exercises and group work handouts and articles  ipcc report from 2014 2015 the course will introduce the students to the role that oceans play in global climate  how they are responding to climate change and their potential in mitigating climate change effects  the focus is on understanding the inter connected effects of physical and chemical processes  changing environment and marine biota  and their feed back mechanisms to the global climate  the course aims at giving the students insights into climate research and observation technology  while promoting an understanding of the complex issues of anthropogenic stressors  ecosystem services and societal costs of global change  the course provides students with the knowledge necessary to contribute to aspects of un sustainable development goals 13 climate action and 14 life below water  such as the target 13 3  improve education  awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation  adaptation  impact reduction and early warning
