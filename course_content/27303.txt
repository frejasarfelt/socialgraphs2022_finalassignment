the course uses the textbook  biophysical chemistry by klostermeier and rudolph  crc press 2017   we will focus on the  methods  section  part iv  of the book  but make frequent references to other sections on structure and function of proteins  the course also includes a basic and practical introduction to the principles within spectroscopy  thermodynamics  kinetics  scattering and computational analyses that underlies the methods  the course covers a wide range of areas in protein science including protein structure and folding  post translational modifications  protein protein and protein ligand interactions  protein engineering  proteome analysis and recombinant protein production  the course will include a practical part that will introduce the students to refinement and x ray structure evaluations of original data  the student will be introduced to selected techniques they can be examined in and they will be asked to prepare a short presentation for each of them  for the oral exam they will draw one of the techniques and give the presentation they have prepared for this topic lectures  exercises and x ray structure refinement exercisethe course introduces selected methods used to characterize structure  stability and interactions of proteins  we will work with both the theoretical underpinnings of the measuring principles  application of the methods and critical assessment of the results  this will include a thorough discussion of the forces and mechanisms that underlie the conformational stability of proteins and drives protein ligand interactions  the course will present a modern view into how method selection is performed prior to the experimental plan in protein science and how analysis of the collected and processed data is driving the decision making process forward  towards the next choice of method   the course will introduce  protein folding  flexibility  and molecular structure and how the interplay of these features impacts protein function in various areas of biochemistry and biotechnology  insight into how protein folding and post translational modifications influence recombinant production of proteins  understanding of how bioanalytical techniques are used for protein identification and characterization  understanding of the relationship between function and structure for membrane transporters  experience in project work  written and oral communication of scientific data the course is taught in autumn 2022 for the last time
