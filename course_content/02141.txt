the course covers two main topics    1  formal languages and their use for describing syntax  for regular languages we consider their relation to  deterministic and non deterministic  finite automata  practical applications  searching in texts  lexical analysis  and some key theoretical properties  including closure and decidability properties   for context free languages we consider their applications  in parsing programs  documents and formatted data  together with a brief introduction to pushdown automata and their relationship to context free languages    2  formal methods and their use for both modelling and analysis of properties of it systems  this includes semantics and interpretation  program analysis  security analysis and model checking  the systems on formalmethods dk are used to assist the learning    the course includes hands on experience with various tools  and the students are asked to solve theoretical as well as practical exercises  which integrate the two topics of the course lectures  theoretical exercises  programming exercises and a mandatory assignment  1   introduction to automata theory  languages  and computation   by john e  hopcroft  rajeev motwani  jefrey d  ullman  third edition  addison wesley  2007   the course handbook  02141  automata theory and languages  compiled by hanne riis nielson covers the necessary chapters   2   formal methods   an appetizer  by flemming nielson og hanne riis nielson  springer  2019  videos on youtube channel formalmethodsdk  slides and on line systems at formalmethods dkthe students learn to apply the central models and formalisms introduced in the course and to use software tools related to these formalisms the course is given in english
