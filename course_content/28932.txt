in groups of 2 persons the following tasks are performed  1  5 exercises based on unit operation  process control and reaction engineering large scale experiments  the exercises are identical with the experiments offered for course 28123  international summer university course  with the following exceptions  to the ordinary manual are added a number of tasks comprising a selection of more advanced experimental work  more calculations  scale up considerations are included  as well as modeling and increased theoretical details  see the list on detailed supplementary tasks in the connected appendix   the report work is limited to results from calculations  process and safety discussions conclusions  uncertainty calculations and synopsis  the selection of experiments is according to the principles in course 28121  but limited to max one process control or one reaction engineering exercise out of the total 5 experiments  the reports are discussed with the teacher and if necessary revised  estimated time spent 160 h  2  a report on the production and systems design principles of the following utilities  process steam  clean steam  compressed air and various water qualities  estimated time spent 25 h   additionally each student must 3  read background material and participate in a lecture on valves  pumps  instruments and special analytical and sampling methods  where working principles and functionality  design details  application and accuracy are covered  estimated time spent 6 h  4  based on given information of a process plant the student will give a lecture room presentation of the resulting detailed pi diagram  estimated time spent 4 h 5 experiments and reports in groups of 2 persons  discussions  lectures  oral presentation  this course is only avaliable for  phd students who will be teaching assistants  ta  in course 28123  summer school  and 28121 or 28125any textbooks in unit operations  process control  reaction engineering  lab  manuals and compendium to train the students in operating large scale process plants  to understand the details in the industrial design and properties of industrial components  to relate the chemistry and engineering theory to practical application and to troubleshoot the operational results  the course will provide the student with an advanced background for designing his her own experimental setup  for planning and execution of experiments and for drawing the engineering conclusions from the results and process experiences  in addition the course will give a good background for work as assistant teacher during ordinary large scale experimental courses this course is only avaliable for  phd students who will be teaching assistants  ta  in course 28123  summer school  and 28121 or 28125exercises performed during a previous course cannot be selected again  detailed supplementary tasks  see separate appendix to phd course 28924  to be presented by the course teachers
