with the increased biological knowledge about  e g   the human genome and the association between genes and diseases  molecular diagnostics is becoming an increasingly important tool for the health sector  in particular  molecular diagnostics is the basis for precision medicine  i e  to provide the patient with best possible care in a given situation based on genetic information    the course covers three clinical fields with increasing complexity of analysis and precision medicine    the first part addresses microbiological diagnostics and associated techniques  here the basic concepts of using virus or bacteria specific genes as biomarker for diagnosing infections are introduced  the course addresses the importance of multiplex test in order to map the genetics of the microorganism for patient stratification and different treatment options     in the second part  monogenetic and polygenetic disorders and risk profiles are addressed  here we aim to understand scope and impact of genetic variance on medical treatment and procedure  the associated techniques used in genetic analyses are explained and evaluated     in the third part  cancer diagnostics and precision medicine are the focuses   here  usage of genetic methods for quantitative measurements are addressed in order to either detect cancer at early stage or to monitor treatment results  modern cancer drugs are very expensive and ideally only used on patients that can benefit from them  these decisions are based on molecular  often quantitative  methods  examples to illustrate the approach is bcr abl transcript measurements and mutation analysis in cml patients  egfr ras mutational analysis for treating colon cancers and analysis of for instance pdl1 expression  for guiding immunotherapy     increasing usage of cutting edge technologies such as high throughput sequencing and digital pcr combined with advanced sample preparation methods can address many kinds of samples such a cell free dna  rare dna   circulating tumour cells  rare cells  and exosomes  cell remnants   the course will investigate the diagnostic advantage and clinical and societal impact of such cutting edge technologies the lectures are on video and the course hours are used to define  solve and discuss relevant problems  posters  short lectures and short case descriptions are used in training sessions to identify what is important for molecular diagnostics and precision medicine  the short cases gives opportunities to get feedback on written presentations  this feedback can be used for the final report that gives the grade  the course can be followed as remote learning video lecture  lecture slides   case reports  articles  mcq training setthe objective of the course is to give students an insight into molecular diagnostics and the relationship to precision medicine  this includes understanding the medical problem  evaluating the molecular methods applied and predicting the impact of introducing better diagnostics methods on the treatment results  the trends of molecular diagnostics will be analyzed  in particular how diagnostics contribute to giving patients correct treatments  e g  biologicals such as antibodies  antibiotics  immunotherapy  including no treatment there will be assignments in smaller groups during the course  as well as internal presentations
