the course contains lectures and exercises about neural networks for computer vision  the exercises takes the student from a concrete problem within computer vision to a solution based on neural networks  topics covered include image recognition and understanding tasks such as image classification  object detection  semantic segmentation and image generation the course consists of lectures and practical exercises  it will be structured as three weeks each covering a different class of problems  each week the students will make a poster on their results and findings  these will form the basis of an oral examination many computer vision tasks were traditionally solved based on hand crafted features  but are now solved using deep learning  examples of such tasks include object detection  segmentation  classification and generative modelling  in this course the student will learn about some of these tasks and how to solve them with deep learning  this will enable the student to identify and describe a problem within computer vision  solve it using a suitable neural network architecture and analyze the performance of the solution
