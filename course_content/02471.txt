course content will vary from year to year  but typically the following learning modules will be included     linear time invariant systems  decomposition of signals  dtft    window functions  stft  spectrogram   independent component analysis  non negative matrix factorization   stochastic processes  correlation functions  wiener filter  linear prediction   stochastic gradient descent  least mean squares adaptive algorithm  recursive least squares   state space models  kalman filters hidden markov models    sparse aware sensing  lasso  sparse priors   compressed sensing  dictionary learning   kernel methods  kernel ridge regression  support vector regression lectures and exercises  each exercise consists of hand derivations of central equations and coding of algorithms  which will then be run on either simulated or real data  hand derivations is a substation part of the course machine learning   a bayesian and optimization perspective  2nd edition  sergios theodoridisto provide the participants  with knowledge of    fundamental and widely applied signal processing methods     matlab or python as a tool for the development of signal processing algorithms  the course enables the participants to derive and construct a modern signal processing system based on machine learningthis course forms together with courses 02456  02460  and 02477 the advanced courses in the area of machine learning  the corresponding introductory machine learning course is 02450  and the corresponding introductory signal course is 22051 or 30160
