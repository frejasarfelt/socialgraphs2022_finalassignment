the course will contain a significant element of statistics and simulation  in addition  an understanding of model systems  how they can be estimated and subsequently used as a basis for simulation and prediction  the course will include the analysis of 4 realistic cases  exercises to be evaluated  with topics to also be defined by the students  this practical work illustrate how different methods can be applied to different domains  the students are expected to acquire the theory  to understand how models are constructed and can be used in practice  the course will apply r and python software and present notebooks for the different applications the course will consist of lectures and 4 group assignments  the assignments consist of both hand outs and a creative project  the creative project is a self defined project where the student bring his her own domain specific knowledge to agent based modelling relevant literature will be provided during the course in the form of journal papers and book chapters society consists of individual entities  agents  who take decisions and interact in space and in time  in this course we look at this interaction between agents and focus on the development of agent based models to describe and simulate the movements of agents in different contexts  this is relevant when monitoring indicators for the environment such as air quality and emissions  monitoring consumption of electricity and water  and describing demand for transport and parking   the course will describe and apply quantitative models for     population synthesis  modelling and prediction of populations  contains elements of matrix estimation and spatial geographic micro simulation    agent based modelling and simulation  introduction of probabilistic models for demand and projections of these  different domains are investigated    balance between supply and demand  examples of what limited supply means for demand and vice versa    agent based interactions  examples of cases and model for how to model interactions is provided     scenario analysis  how do we formulate scenarios and how do we search for intelligent scenarios out of infinite many   in addition  the course will cover relevant cases  with data   such as     prediction of demand for commercial car sharing systems  drivenow and greenmobility     demand for electricity and how this can be linked with electric vehicles     modelling of markets and dynamic pricing   modelling of vehicular systems   the course will give the student insight into state of the art with respect to simulation and agent based modelling  the course will provide the students with tools and relevant cases that can directly feed candidate projects and are relevant i real life the course will be offered for the last time in fall 2022
