the course contents cover fundamental aspects of network security at different layers  physical  mac  network  and transport layers  with emphasis on iot specific challenges  after an initial introduction to network communication architectural models and basic mechanisms  the course focus on typical vulnerabilities and challenges of communication network systems at mac  network  and transport layers  all these  are based on practical hands on labs  there will be experiments and hands on exercises in all lectures   afterward  the course turns focus to specific iot components and technologies to provide a baseline understanding of the systems and devices to protect  furthermore   the course will present elements related to privacy regulations and standards that apply to securing iot systems  the course will include a project work requiring students to design  build  and evaluate a practical iot system  students will be required to demonstrate their prototypes and present orally their projects at the end of the course  documenting their designs and results in a report  it is expected that guest speakers present related topics lectures and exercisesthe course addresses network security challenges at different levels of the osi layer model   the course introduces afterward specific aspects related to iot technologies with a focus on practical cases and setups  students will learn to operate traffic capturing and generating tools  analyze network security vulnerabilities of different protocols and build up and analyze concrete iot related setups  with the aim to increase awareness and understanding of iot data communication security and its incorporation in future designs
