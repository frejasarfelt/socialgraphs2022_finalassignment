earth s magnetic field is generated by a range of different physical processes in the earth s interior and surroundings  dynamo processes in the core  induced electrical currents in the mantle  the magnetization of the crust  ocean currents and prevailing winds in the earth s upper atmosphere  high energy charged particles in the earth s radiation belts  and electric currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere generated in the dynamic interaction between the solar wind and earth s magnetic field  the course will detail the various contributions  how they are observed  separated  described  modelled   interpreted  and used to study the earth system  comparison will also be made with the magnetic fields of other planets and what they reveal about planetary interiors lecture and exercises lecture notes the course presents an introduction to observations and physical theories of earth and planetary magnetism   the focus is on describing the large scale field structure and its time changes   this course provides the tools needed to construct global models of magnetic fields and the physical background needed to interpret magnetic observations made by satellites and on ground   this konweldge form the basis for diverse applications in navigation and  allows the study of planetary interiors
