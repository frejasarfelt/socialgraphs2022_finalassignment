the course introduces the student to the semi classical description as well as to the full quantum theoretical description of the interaction between light  matter and nano structures  these methods are used to describe the light field in various quantum optical states and to describe absorption  emission and photo detection  in the final part of the course we work with the quantum optical description of interference and coherence as well as with noise phenomena in detectors and lasers  we also study the generation and measurement of uniquely quantum optical phenomena such as squeezed light and entanglement  the student is also introduced to the quantum mechanical coupling between light and nano structures in optical micro cavities as well as applications of quantum optics in metrology and informatics  the student is thus introduced to the most current research in quantum optics  in addition to the lectures the students will apply some of the concepts studied in theory by carrying out quantum optical experiments lectures and problem solving modern optics and photonics more and more use quantum physics in the description of optical processes and systems  this is primarily a result of the advances in laser technology and the miniaturisation of optical nano structures  where interactions between small numbers of atoms or even a single atom and photons occur   the goal is to give the student a good general background and a thorough basis for further work within quantum phenomena in the optical domain
