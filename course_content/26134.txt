the chemistry of the d  and f elements is treated comprehensively with particular focus on periodic trends  reactivity  and characterization  this includes organometallic chemistry that lays the foundation for the homogeneous catalysis seen from the transition metal ion perspective  the course is largely based on discussion of scientific articles with a focus on critical assessment of published results lectures  group work  class room discussions  laboratory experiments to give in depth knowledge of the descriptive inorganic chemistry of the d  and f block elements and their most important coordination compounds  organometallic chemistry  and transition metal chemistry in relation to e g  homogeneous catalysis  supramolecular chemistry  and metal organic frameworks  furthermore  the participants are introduced to the standard physical and spectroscopic characterization techniques for inorganic and organometallic compounds  critical reading and analysis of contemporary scientific literature is an integral part of the course
