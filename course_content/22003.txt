psychophysics and physiology of the auditory system  models of auditory signal processing and perception   neurophysiological measuring methods  relation between neurophysiological measurements and psychoacoustical  behavioral  findings  neural imaging techniques  technical and clinical applications  compensation strategies in modern hearing aids and cochlear implants  there are classroom based problem solving sets and seven matlab based exercises that complement some of the lectures in the course lectures and exercises the aim is to obtain an understanding of the processing mechanisms in the auditory system and the perceptual consequences  to learn about functional relationships between the physical attributes of sound and their associated percepts  using a system s approach  to study sensory and brain processing  and their locations  using objective methods such as otoacoustic emissions and auditory evoked potentials  to learn about potential clinical and technical applications by applying auditory model based processing techniques the course is a natural introduction to master thesis work within hearing science and technology e learning is used  in the form of online and interactives quizzes  video recorded lectures  course wiki open for user input  discussion board or blog  web based tools as well as a digital whiteboard
