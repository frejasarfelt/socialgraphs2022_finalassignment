an introduction to possibilities and barriers for implementation of alternative fuels in transportation will be given  in the course the students are presented to theoretical topics related to combustion and air pollution formation in connection with application of different fuels  conventional  biofuels and electro fuels  and technologies  combustion engines electric motors and fuel cells   these topics are  stoichiometry  combustion reactions  physical chemistry  organic chemistry  determination of calorific value and flame temperature  as a general example the student will be introduced to a vehicle with a combustion engine  the students should solve written problems from this example  an essential part of the course is the practical laboratory work where gaseous emission measurements are demonstrated and carried out  samples of particulate matter from the vehicle are analyzed in order to determine their composition as well  in this context different separation and detection principles are presented  the following topics are included  gas liquid and high performance liquid chromatography  open column chromatography and infra red uv fluorescence flame ionization chemiluminescence detectors lectures  problems and exercises in laboratory the purpose with the course is to learn the basic combustion related processes that are responsible for the emissions from transport  emissions from combustion are put into perspective in order to assess the total emissions from current and future transport  taking into account the most realistic future scenarios for future use of fuels and technology  it is an important goal that the students are getting familiar with practical measurements and chemical analysis in relation to combustion of conventional and sustainable fuels
