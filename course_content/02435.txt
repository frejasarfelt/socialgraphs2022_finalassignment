core elements     techniques of optimization under uncertainty  stochastic programming  robust optimization  decomposition techniques  heuristics  scenario generation  key concepts  here and now vs  recourse decisions  1 stage  2 stage and multi stage decision making processes  robust and stochastic solutions  worst case and expected value optimization  risk aversion  heuristics  decomposition techniques  scenario generation  decision rules  value of stochastic solution  expected value of perfect information  etc this course uses lectures  exercises and group assignments the students will be provided with specific technical literature during the course to provide the student with the skills to tackle decision making problems with uncertain information within different application fields  such as energy systems  finance  logistics  by making use of techniques of optimization under uncertainty in many application areas  the decision making process of companies and institutions is plagued with uncertainty   this course deals with techniques to address the decision making processes under uncertainty with appropriate quantitative methods  the concepts are illustrated by application to different areas such as energy systems and finance
