the course is based on a number of cases and practical laboratory exercises  illustrating how dna based methods are applied in analysis of fish populations and for generating information of importance for defining management areas  estimation of population size  identification of illegal  uncontrolled and unreported fishing  conservation of genetic resources  as well as  genetic monitoring  of the impact of human activities such as fishing  supplementation and global change  the course will review basic concepts in relation to how genetic variation is distributed within and among populations   population genetic  parameters  such as mutation  migration  random genetic drift and selection  this includes a discussion of the population concept  effective population size  neutral genes and genes subject to selection  as well as adaptation to local environment  the subjects will be integrated with central general concepts in conservation biology  such as minimum effective population size for avoiding inbreeding and loss of genetic variation  as well as design of protected areas for conservation of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential  recent developments in genetic and genomic research will be addressed  this line of research has provided a wealth of new opportunities in fisheries genetics  for example by identifying genes of important ecological function and fish species from environmental samples  e dna  and processed fish products  the different topics will be integrated through evaluation of how human induced environmental alterations like climate change and fisheries induced evolution are expected to affect future adaptation  distribution and abundance of fish populations  effects of different management and conservation tools  i e  marine protected areas  supplementation and fisheries regulations  will be evaluated in relation to mitigating potential negative genetic effects  students select their own case study  which serve as the basis for an assignment lectures  guest lectures  group work laboratory and computer exercises the aim of the course is to provide students with theoretical and practical knowledge about how modern dna based methods can be used in management of fisheries resources and biodiversity conservation in aquatic environments  through seminars and laboratory exercises students will learn how genetic methods are used to identify fish species and to partition fish into genetically separated populations  stocks   and how this knowledge can be applied as a tool in fisheries management  such as for defining management units and for enforcement of fisheries regulations  students are expected to understand and analyse how human activities such as fishing  habitat alteration and climate change can affect biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems and how genetic composition and human evolutionary impact affect the survival and productivity of fish populations  finally  the students are expected to be able to analyse the consequences of different management strategies on the genetic diversity on all levels of biological organisation from individual over population to species and be able to predict consequences of individual management strategies for survival and productivity of wild fish populations in marine and freshwater environments this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  2  zero huger    12  responsible consumption and production  and  14  life below water
