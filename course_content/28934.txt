see annex 1the course will be a mix of lectures  exercises in the lecture room and a homework assignment this course aims to provide participants with an understanding of the theory and skills needed to make decisions related to on line sensor selection in view of establishing closed loop control on a model fermentation process  yeast   participants will be introduced to the theory of process control  and will learn how to use model simulations to study the effect of applying control to a bioreactor  on line sensor concepts will be introduced  and the participants will learn how to work with on line data  first in terms of detecting outliers and replacing missing values  and then for classification the course is part of the aim bio course portfolio developed at dtu bioengineering and dtu chemical engineeringsome basic knowledge of matlab or python is an advantage but not a must
