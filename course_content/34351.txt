the course will deal with general aspects of network access and use concrete  standards  to exemplify basic trends and differences  the course will evaluate and compare the possibility of increased capacity in the cable network with the flexibility and mobility of wireless networks  within the public part of the network  solutions will focus on reuse of the existing infrastructure  e g  cable modem or xdsl   and solutions that require new optical fiber cables  e g  pons   there will be great focus on understanding the basic principles and comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the different solution models   for the home network  focus will also be on comparing the various prevailing technologies and techniques  such as bluetooth  zigbee  wifi  lifi  usb  firewire and ethernet  and focusing on how home equipment integrates physical and protocol technical  it will also be seen how parts of the home network can be physically placed outside the home in  for example  cloud solutions   the course will also address the gateway function and seamless interworking aspects of cross communication between the private and public areas and between wired and wireless domains   within the general network aspects  the course will deal with some of the latest ideas on how to restructure networks  for example  based on a media converter that gathers the various access formats and directs data to the most advantageous content distribution networks   in relation to these aspects  the course will provide a general review of the building of data centers and methods for virtualization of these resources as well as security aspects in relation to  for example   smart homes  ehealth and similar applications lecturesthe course provides a broad overview of methods and techniques used to connect different types of terminals  for example  private household appliances  entertainment electronics  telemedicine measuring equipment  sensors  and similar m2m devices  to a communications network  the course will primarily focus on the wired networks and networks using non licensed frequency bands  mobile communication is covered in 34330 and 34343   both the traditional problem of being connected to a public or global network and the appearance of the home network that can connect are considered  the course will cover both the physical transmission parts focusing on the different multiplexing methods generally used to achieve high bandwidth efficiency for media with varying characteristics as well as protocol hierarchical aspects that ensure integration of many different applications with very different quality needs and requirements for network performance  qos   finally  the course will discuss the influence of the general network architecture as well as control  management and planning of a network   including a general introduction to the statistical conditions related to traffic aggregation that help secure a cost optimized connection to the network
