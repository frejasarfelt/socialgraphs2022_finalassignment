yeasts and molds are often used as model organisms in basic research and as cell factories in industrial processes  this laboratory course focuses on construction of yeast and filamentous fungal strains using genetic engineering  this involves classical genetic and molecular biology based methods as well as modern crispr technology  in the course  students work in small teams  each aiming at developing their own strain or set of strains  the typical task is to delete or insert specific genes in order to make strains that allow a specific biological question to be addressed  the individual projects therefore constitute a miniature research project  hence  based on a specific scientific question new strains will be constructed  subsequent characterization of the strains will then address the initial question asked  the projects will typically involve baker s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae or a filamentous fungus like aspergillus niger  the genetic modifications will be implemented by using a state of the art genetic tool box containing  bio blocks  like promoters  reporter genes  terminators  the course will finish with small presentations  where student teams present their biological question  the experimental strategy  as well as their results in a session including the entire class   the performance in the course  including the presentations  will then be evaluated as pass not pass laboratory exercises to provide the student with extensive practical experience in molecular biological  genetic and physiological handling of eukaryotes this course is recommended after course 27230 and 27430
