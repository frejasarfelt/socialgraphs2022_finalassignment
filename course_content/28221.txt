tools for calculation of physical properties  including residual properties  from equations of state and from generalized method are developed by means of spreadsheets  these tools are used for designing processes for cooling and for liquefaction of gasses  finally  the physico chemical model description of fluid mixtures is essential for most separation processes  the course deals with models for the excess properties of the liquid phase and their application for simple phase equilibrium calculations for gas liquid  liquid liquid and liquid solid systems computer based problem solution by means of spreadsheets where user developed or pre developed modules are combined for simulation of larger units  teamwork involving groups of 2 or 3 students  supplementary overview lectures required text  michael l  michelsen   chemical engineering thermodynamics  available from the department of chemical engineering  supplementary reference  j richard elliott  carl t  lira   introductory chemical engineering thermodynamics  2nd ed  the overall objective is to enable the students to apply chemical engineering thermodynamics in the solution of practical  industrial problems  including addressing sustainability
