the course aims to provide an introduction to computing systems and to provide a basic understanding of the hardware infrastructure on which software is running upon  special focus is given to the fsmd model of computation and to small resource constrained systems  such as embedded and cyber physical systems   the course is divided into four main sections   1  models of computation and software   2  hardware architectures   3  system level design  and  4  related topics  the fsmd model is used as a common thread between all the sections    in the first section  the course provides a general overview of computing systems with a special focus on the meaning of computing and models of computation  we introduce the concept of the fsmd model  the role of control and data flow graph  the basics of compilers  and the role of instruction set architectures  furthermore  we introduce the c programming language targeting small resource constrained systems    the second section is dedicated to hardware architectures and presents basic rtl hardware components  the structure of a general purpose processor  and the design of simple hardware accelerators based on the fsmd model  here  we introduce the chisel hdl language to develop and simulate part of a computing architecture based on the fsmd model   finally  the third and fourth sections address the challenges of system integration and performance analysis  and provide an introduction to control systems and computer networks lectures  exercises  and projects work  embedded systems design  a unified hardware software introduction  by frank vahid and tony givargis  wileycomputer systems have become an integral part of our society  they are the foundation for a wide range of technologies from small devices  internet of things  smartphones  etc   to large ones  servers  cloud  etc    in this course  we explore how computers work  more specifically  we study the tight relationship between hardware and software needed to develop efficient computer systems and we address the opportunities and limitations of modern computer systems the course is partially taught in english the course is partially taught in english
