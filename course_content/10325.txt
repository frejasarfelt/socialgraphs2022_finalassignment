this is an application oriented course on electron structure theory of molecules and solid state materials  and especially  electron or phonon  transport theory for nanosystems  you will write and use your own computer code written in mathematica or similar high level programming language   you will be introduced to the theoretical methods enabling you to calculate electronic transport using green s functions in the first half part of the course  this is done by solving problems and using mathematica  no prior knowledge is necessary    in the second half of the course you will apply the methods on a concrete problem in a project  the results and their presentation are part of the course evaluation   the topics are chosen so as to match active research at dtu physics  these will therefore change from year to year   typical topics include   electronic structure and transport in graphene nanostuctures or other 2d materials  molecular contacts  or 1d nanotubes group work by using computers in 3 weeks  8 hours per day notes today it is possible to design new materials and nanostructures with special properties by performing computer simulations  such simulations are based on quantum mechanical models of the systems  the goal of this course is to give you a knowledge of the basic quantum mechanical models and their use  focusing on electronic transport in nanostructures the course is offered both in danish and english
