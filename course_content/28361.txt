teaching is built around a number of model examples  which broadly describe the statements of the problems with the chemical  and biotechnical contents  the problems are solved numerically  applying matlab as a tool  the possible typical model examples are  the choice may be different in the different years     modelling of the enzymatic hydrolyses of cellulose   modelling of the combustion processes   modelling of particle coating  with agglomeration   chromatografical separation  linear and nonlinear isotherms  multiphase flows in porous media  including deep bed filtration and carbon dioxide underground storage lectures  project work in the groups of 2 3 studentsthe main teaching materials for the course are notes and additional materials uploaded to campusnet  the optional literature is   r  rice and d  do  applied mathematics and modeling for chemical engineers  j  wiley and sons  n y   1995  electronic version of the book is freely available for the dtu students at the knovel database the basic formulation of the models of chemical engineering is supposed to be known from the introductory course 28160  the main goal of the present course is to prepare a student for development of the mathematical models for a large number of the complex and realistic chemical and biotechnical problems  also involving sustainability  and for carrying out numerical solutions of such problems
