authentication of individuals based on the biological and behavioural characteristics such as the face  the iris or fingerprints is a promising research domain  biometric algorithms allow the recognition of individuals in physical or logical access control systems and thus provide an efficient and convenient alternative to knowledge based or token based systems   the lecture covers the most important mechanisms in today s commercial biometric systems  face recognition  iris recognition and fingerprint recognition  the course covers sensors  biometric image processing  feature extraction and classification methods  furthermore evaluation schemes for biometric systems will be discussed such as biometric performance testing and security testing  the lecture will also map data privacy principles to the biometric system design process   the complementary seminar extends the content of the lecture with topics on current application areas  theses topics are researched and analysed  specific focus is given on applications that are specific for the european data privacy culture   furthermore the seminar will discuss interoperability issues and international standardization in the field  the seminar will address selected topics from current biometric research regarding 3d face recognition  biometric sample quality  multimodal biometrics and biometric template protection  e g  www 3dface org lectures and individual projects course literature will be indicated during the course   additional reading material will be provided through the teachers website   http   www christoph busch de teaching biometric systems htmlthe students should develop    an understanding of the principles used in biometrics algorithms and  systems    a knowledge of the most important biometric approaches    the capability to select a suitable algorithm   system for a given application context  e g  physical access control    a good understanding of the complex relationships between biometric systems and environmental conditions  e g  illumination  pose variations etc   and their impact on biometric performance    the capability to assess the security properties of a biometric system    an understanding of data privacy principles and the impact on the design and configuration of biometric systems the course is given by professor christoph busch from the hochschule darmstadt fraunhofer institute for computer graphic research  igd  in darmstadt  germany
