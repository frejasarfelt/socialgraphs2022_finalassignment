the course is built around a number of specific themes that include research theoretical study as well as conduction of practical experiments that involve biocatalytic reactions  emphasis is put on unravelling the theory behind the reactions and on designing and conducting the practical experiments  the course curriculum includes assessment of selected large scale processes in which biocatalytic steps are involved  complex processes that involve advanced exploitation of biocatalysed conversions are also examined  the reactions to be covered relate to specific scientific phenomena  selected industrial applications  and to current research topics  the experimental work is carried out in teams of two  and each team will work with a selection of cases  teams circulate among cases   in addition to the laboratory work  time is allocated for discussing the scientific fundamentals  data interpretation  and for understanding the reaction mechanisms  kinetics  substrate specificity  enzyme stability and synergism between different enzyme activities  each case must be summarized in a short report including answering of specific  questions relating to the particular case one weekly module with lectures  laboratory exercises  discussions  problem solution exercises  and report work to introduce the students to enzyme kinetics in practice and research methods in applied enzyme technology  the course is based on practical experimental methods and analyses within applied biocatalysis and enzyme technology  after completion of the course  the course participants will be able to    design  conduct and interpret various types of enzyme activity assays   examine and interpret quantitative  experimental data from biocatalytic reactions  and understand the importance of considering blanks  substrate specificity  artificial vs  complex component substrates  heterogeneous enzyme preparations   plan and conduct experiments to estimate kinetic parameters and analyse progressing biocatalytic  reactions   design a biocatalytic process for a large scale application   the academic qualifications obtained are targeted towards jobs research and development jobs within biochemical  pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies as well as in academia if you plan to do your msc project in one of the major biotechnology companies it is advisable to have had this course
