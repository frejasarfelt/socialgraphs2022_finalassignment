this short course will present fundamentals of uncertainty quantification for inverse problems  the idea is to cover both  computational methods  e g   monte carlo  random field discretization  markov chain monte carlo   and theoretical aspects  e g   basic proofs  convergence properties  well posedness    we start by presenting an overall introduction to uq and reviewing probability theory  this is performed with a very simple example that illustrates what is uq and why is it good for us  next  we explore monte carlo methods for the simulation of random variables and estimation of expectations  after these introductory topics  we cover essential elements of uq for forward problems  especially the modeling and discretization of random variables and fields  as well as  forward well posedness  the main numerical examples are also introduced in this section  finally  we discuss the main component of the course  where we explore uq for inverse problems  the idea is to formulate elemental inverse problems and present statistical approaches to solve them  we emphasize on bayesian inference methods  hence  we talk about likelihoods noise models  and prior distributions as mechanism of regularization  the solution of the bayesian inverse problem  given in terms of posterior statistics  is computed via markov chain monte carlo sampling   the course aims at giving a hands on experience  i e   the student will learn how to apply a method and how to interpret the associated results  therefore  lectures explaining the theory will be followed by exercise sessions lectures and exercises  theory and computations uncertainty quantification  uq  is the science of characterization and management of randomness in computational models of real world applications  uq blends theories and methods crossing stochastic analysis  statistical modeling and scientific computing   this course introduces state of the art numerical methods for quantification and reduction of uncertainties in computational models  uq is paramount to enhance analysis and prediction tasks in multiple applications such as tomography  material science  spatial statistics  reliability  etc  therefore  the course can be of interest to students from any discipline in applied mathematics and engineering  the course provides the mathematical background for theory and methods of uq  which are illustrated via python exercises  examples covered in the course include elemental models of deconvolution  diffusion and structural engineering the course is given every second year in january  i e   january 2024  january 2026  etc
