the course gives an overview of the different elements of cell factory design with a number of examples on how directed metabolic modifications have been introduced with the aim of obtaining improved strains for production of different compounds in the bioindustry  there is especially focus on the different tools of cell factory design  and the course covers the following topics  introduction to cell factory design  overview of biochemical pathways  regulation of pathways  examples of cell factory design  design of experiments for characterization of strains  metabolic flux analysis  theory and applications  application of 13c isotopes for quantification of metabolic fluxes  genomics  whole genome transcription analysis  proteome analysis  metabolome analysis  methods for evaluation of omics data   omics data integration with cell factory models  different case stories are used to illustrate the topics  students will work independently with examples and with a group task  which will be presented both orally and in a written report  in the group task  students are introduced to a real life cell factory design case and are supposed to suggest innovative strain improvement strategies lectures  group exercises  seminars  and problem solvingthe aim of the course is to give the students a fundamental understanding of the interplay between the many different intracellular reactions in a cell factory  and especially how the fluxes through the different pathways are regulated  a special focus is given to pathways leading to industrially relevant products like primary metabolites  antibiotics  industrial enzymes  and pharmaceutical proteins  a central aspect of the course is the computational modeling of cell factories to help identify the optimal strategies for introducing directed genetic changes in the microorganisms with the aim of obtaining better production strains  analysis of the interaction between different cellular reactions is a central element in the course  and tools for systems level strain characterization and design will be described  taking advantage of a number of computational modeling tools  students will learn to model and design cell factories using primarily programming code the course is aimed at biotechnology students  but the course can also be taken by students with a chemical engineering background  who wishes to get an introduction to aspects of bioinformatics and optimization of biocatalysts  basic knowledge of python  or other programming languages  is highly recommended  loops  conditionals  basic data types like lists  dictionaries etc    there is a chance to carry out strategies suggested in the group assignment in practice in the 3 weeks course 27432
