the course covers the most important methods for visualisation of micro and nano structures used at dtu and associated companies  the topics are   	optical microscopy  om   	scanning electron microscopy  sem   	transmission electron microscopy  tem   	scanning tunneling microscopy  stm   	atomic force microscopy  afm   the methods are introduced in dedicated hands on exercises  you will get access to state of the art equipment for visualization purposes  this will contribute to the understanding of the methods   furthermore  you will present and evaluate a scientific article and its use of visualization methods lectures and exercises  4 hours a week compendium for the course 22602  previously 33257 micro  and nanostructures are central elements in a long range of research and industrial projects and products   the goal of this course is to give you an overview of methods for visualisation of these structures and to understand the underlying physics    with this knowledge you will be able to choose the best suited techniques for a given task and to diagnosticate and further develop these visualisation techniques   furthermore  you will be able to interpret the informations provided by these techniques  this can both be in the form of a shape of the sample  topography  and its material properties
