the theoretical subject matter is primarily learned by computational exercises and a few lectures  the course comprises in addition 8 experimental exercises  which all must be completed and approved  moreover  two multiple choice tests have to be passed  the rest of the course consists of the so called  consultancy project   where you as part of a group will solve a concrete measurement task at one of the research groups in one of the participating departments  the consultancy task is documented in a data treatment journal and also presented for your fellow students and the teachers on a poster at a poster session at the end of the course lectures  laboratory exercises  theoretical exercises  experimental group workjohn r  taylor   an introduction to error analysis   2 nd edition  university science books in addition  course notes will be distributed electronically at the course start the overall goal is to introduce the physics and nanotechnology students to the laboratory work in the physics and nanotechnology field of study  this is achieved by conducting a series of experimental exercises in physics and basic electronics  moreover  it is the goal to learn a systematic and quantitative approach to data analysis  and to learn basic electronics  further  it is the goal to apply the acquired skills to conduct a measurement task  the  consultancy project   within a research group at one of the participating departments  and to estimate the uncertainties of the associated data
