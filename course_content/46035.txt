most of the time  the students will work in the laboratory in project teams  introductory lectures are given on    demand response for smart houses and related ict technology    specific demand response in smart houses  applications  projects     a 32 bit arm microcontroller arduino mkr1000 1010  system and its peripherals  a d and d a converters  timer  i o  pwm  interrupter  and lcd display  etc   including their corresponding registers  programming    the integrated development environment arduino embedded workbench    communication systems in intelligent energy systems    user centered interface designintroductory lectures and project teamworksmart houses are introduced as the vision of a future energy optimized households  which are based on renewable energy sources and intelligent apparatus  examples of smart houses technologies are household appliances that react intelligently to varying system conditions  automatic mechanisms for coordination of resources  and advanced information exchange systems  the objective of this course is to gain hands on experience with technologies used in such systems  by designing  implementing and testing a smart house application on a microcontroller based  embedded system   the learnings from the course can also be applied to smart grids and intelligent energy systems the course is mandatory for students following  sustainable enegy design
