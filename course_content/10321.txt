in this course you learn about nanosystems  how they work and how they can be applied in practice    a  nanosystem  is a system  for which the function depends on one or more of its compnents having feature sizes in the 1 100 nanometer range  to be able to design and create a nanosystem  you will work with the physical properties of the nanostructures as well as their function when integrated in a system    the course is closely connected to today s and future applications of nanotechnology within the key areas of  1  carbon based nanosystems   2  biological nanosystems   3  nanooptical systems and  4  nanofluidic systems   5  electron microscopy of nanosystems and biological materials and  6  ferroelectric elastic nanosystems  the topic of nanosafety and nanotoxicology will also be briefly discussed    the course is a dynamic and interactive combination of lectures  discussions  small projects and exercises  where you will be challenged in many different ways   through six home assignments you will work closer with the material  and familiarise yourself with sometimes complex problems and their importance for selected nanosystems lectures as well as exercises solved during the lectures and at home the course will be based on lecture notes which will be made available electronically in the course you will learn how to use your basic knowledge of physics to analyse and design nanosystems  and to evaluate how they can be used in practice  you will learn how the different physical properties of nanostructures can be exploited to find better technological solutions
