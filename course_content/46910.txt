the workload in the course will focus on the study of a number of nonlinear problems  which include building up  solving and evaluating the solutions from realistic finite element problems  throughout the work with the finite element exercises  important points using a commercial finite element code will be addressed  cases involving isotropic elastic  anisotropic elastic and elastic plastic material laws will be studied  in addition  user defined subroutines and python scripting be will used the course is built up as problem based learning  pbl  or problem solving learning course  respectively  which means that required  functioning knowledge that can be put to work on spot is taught to solve problems after they have been taught by the lectures the course will introduce the use of the commercial finite element code abaqus in a research oriented way where a number of nonlinear problems will be addressed  the focus will be on creating  analyzing and evaluating nonlinear material simulations  simulations of fibre reinforced composites and crack growth predictions for master student it is possible to replace some of the most research oriented exercises with more applied exercises
