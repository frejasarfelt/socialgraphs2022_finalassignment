this course will introduce microbes and microbial principles with an environmental science   technology and public health perspective  after a short overview of the diversity of microbial metabolism  quantitative topics of energy conservation  growth stoichiometry and kinetics will follow  then  specific attention will be given on microbial ecological principles  modulation of microbial activity by the physical and chemical constraints of the environment will be discussed  microbial responses and interactions will be described  and methods for quantification of microbial presence  abundance  and activity in various environmental matrices are introduced  the microbial component of several biogeochemical cycles will be exposed  the effect of physicochemical properties of microbes on their dynamics in the environment will be introduced  and specific attention will be paid on pathogen fate and survival  generic and specific methods for microbial growth control and antibiotic resistance will be discussed lectures  group work  exercises   quizzes brock biology of microorganisms intnl edition   14th edition the goal of this course is to equip students with the knowledge and tools necessary to appreciate  identify  interpret  and analyse microbes and microbial processes in technical and environmental systems and anthropogenically disturbed natural environments
