we will cover a large fraction of the following multidimensional models  multidimensional distributions  multiple and partial correlation   the general linear model  estimation and testing  geometric interpretation   regression analysis  estimation and testing  determination of best regression equations  analysis of residuals  prediction intervals  non linear analysis etc  multidimensional analysis of variance  classification  bayesian classifiers  linear and quadratic discriminant analysis  canonical discriminant analysis   canonical analysis  canonical correlation  principal components  factor analysis    correlation models  models for random phenomena which vary in time and space  applications of sas in the above areas lectures  tutorials  computer exercises  and mini projects to give the participants a more thorough understanding of statistical methods with special emphasis on revealing the structure of multidimensional data  the participants are expected to learn to assess multidimensional  linear and non linear  relations and estimate best predictors  to analyze the influence of complicated experimental designs on  uni  or multi dimensional  measurements  to assess whether multidimensional data can be reduced to lower dimensionality and in doing this  to assess whether a number of features in a population can be described with a few  factors   to discriminate between different populations using simple  linear  functions of measurements of different features of the single individuals  to assess the structure of and relations between phenomena which vary in time  lastly to be able to use a standard statistical computer program  sas  and be able to interpret the output and relate it to the course curriculum the written exam for the winter of 2020 will be held on campus the course is a general methodological course aimed at students interested in the analysis of multidimensional data or in achieving an overview over a number of the most common statistical methods
