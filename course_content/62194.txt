the students will learn structured and object oriented programming by programming lego mindstorms robots as well as pcs   the students will work with    installation of software   crossplatform development   different operating systems such as windows and linux   the organization and programs use of ram  during programming students will learn to use    controll structures  conditions  and loops   classes and objects   user defined classes   variables and datatypes   text strings   arrays and lists   methods  parameters  and return values   console input output   read and write text files   the structure of object orientated programs   programs with several source files   an ide for program development  by developing their own robots and programs students learn    to analyze  design  and implement software systems   to use common uml diagrams   to describe it systems in words and writing  by building the lego robots students learn about    what robots can be used for   motors that enables robots to move   different sensors providing robots with input   quality of sensors and handling of sensor data   communication between pc and robot   external factors that might influence robot operation   autonomes robotsclass teaching  programming exercises  and blended learning to give students a basic understanding of structured and object orientated programming that allows them to cooperate with it developers on projects involving programming
