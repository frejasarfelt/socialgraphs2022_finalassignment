efficient  reliable and robust solution of engineering problems require solution strategies that have been developed through a systematic analysis of the needs of the problems being solved and the development and use of methods and tools that can match these needs  in process and product design  the solution strategies also need to provide innovative and new solutions  a systems approach allows the development of the necessary solution strategies through a systematic analysis of all aspects of the specified problem or a set of problems  because of the potentially large range of topics that can be covered  a selection of topics will be considered each year  based on the background of the participant s  and the current state of the art  examples of topics are as follows  systematic computer aided product formulation  computer aided molecular design  systematic model identification   design of experiments  a systems approach to development of sustainable process technologies  machine learning including design of data and model identification techniques  using radial basis function  artificial neural network  gaussian process modeling  kriging   global sensitivity analysis based on metamodeling  using polynomial chaos expansion  modified adaptive response splines  mars   among others   stochastic programming and monte carlo based optimization algorithms  advanced and nonlinear optimization and control techniques  etc  each topic will be analyzed in terms of the generic problem definition and solution strategy  verification of the proposed systems approach  the advantages disadvantages of the approach  identification and testing of possible improvements  finally  a systems approach to solving of process and product engineering problems will be highlighted together with the latest developments in terms of computer aided methods   tools  the selected topic will be applied to a selected case studies defined and prepared by the participants lectures as well as relevant literature papers materials on selected topics of current interest in process systems engineering will be provided to the course participants  to be used as self study by the participants  a selected topic  pse method  tool  algorithm  etc  will be applied and evaluated critically to a case study defined by participants  a seminar to present the results and critical discussion by all participants will be scheduled depends upon the topic  there are not necessarily textbooks for the course  a collection of relevant papers  maximum 10  published on the advanced topic of interest will define the subject material and the background reading this course is aimed at introducing special topics from the current state of the art in process systems engineering  the objective is to give the participants a quick and thorough introduction to relevant advanced topics in process systems engineering  which otherwise would not be possible due to lack of formal courses on such topics  examples of such advanced topics includes among others machine learning techniques  metamodeling  surrogate modelling   monte carlo and quasi monte carlo optimization  advanced nonlinear control and optimization  computer aided product design  among others  at the same time  the course will help the participants in getting a broader view on the art of systematic analysis for efficient  robust and innovative solution strategies  depending on the defined selected topic by the course participants and the instructors  one or more of the below learning objectives apply visiting professors and or researchers to the department during the period of the course will be drafted as additional course lecturers and participants for the topic discussion sessions
