the theoretical part of the course covers an introduction to basic microbiology in regards to the structure of microorganisms  growth and diversity  selected structural and functional properties such as nutritional requirements  and antibiotic resistance are related to microbiological methods  the theory of selected statistical tools are presented in relation to their application in the analysis of microbiological data   the experimental work employs classical microbiological techniques for isolation of pure bacterial colonies  determination of cfu in a culture  od measurements and selective plating  students will also use molecular microbiology methods such quantitative real time pcr  qpcr   and maldi tof  students will analyze the data generated during the course using the relevant statistical tools and present the results in concise reports lectures  group work including theoretical exercises  oral presentations and laboratory exercises the overall aim of the course is to provide the students with skills in microbiological laboratory techniques and use of statistical tools to analyze and evaluate microbiological data generated during the course  practical laboratory work and statistical calculations are integrated in the course students from the bachelor in life science and technology have priority for seats in this course  students from other programs can be admitted if there are vacant seats    it is important that students participate in all of the activities during this 3 week period
