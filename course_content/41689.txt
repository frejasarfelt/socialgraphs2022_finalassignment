the course has a basic part on the degradation of metals caused by corrosion and wear  topics include  electrochemistry  corrosion types  corrosion environments  corrosion testing and monitoring  corrosion protection  including cathodic protection  effects of environmental change and use of coatings to prevent degradation  the course also contains a description of high temperature corrosion under various conditions and material use  testing and protection against high temperature corrosion  wear types and mechanisms as well as description of methods to avoid wear are described  mechanical degradation mechanisms such as creep and fatigue are described and technological sectors where these degradation mechanisms are addressed classroom lectures including assignmentsto obtain a general knowledge of metal performance and degradation in various environments  atmospheric corrosion  aqueous corrosion  high temperature corrosion  as well as mechanical degradation  including fatigue  wear and creep  it is a course objective to gain knowledge of common corrosion types and to be able to identify the environmental factors for these degradation forms to occur   the course also describes wear mechanisms and anti wear measures  the student should be able to select the optimal material solution and measures against degradation on the basis of relevant information and requirements for the material  chemical and mechanical influences  as well as from failure analysis  the student should be able to take sustainability and recycling of metals into account when selecting materials for demanding conditions
