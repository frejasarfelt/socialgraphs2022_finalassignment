1 basic concepts introduction  why it is necessary to evaluate uncertainty  requirements of quality standards and transfer of measurement information 1 1 measurement uncertainty typical contributes to measurement uncertainty  random and systematic effects and measurement accidents  outliers  1 2 metrological characteristics relationship between uncertainty contributes and instrument characteristics  bias  repeatability  resolution  and measurement complex  reproducibility  considering instrument  operator  ambient conditions and measurand   2 stages of uncertainty evaluation theoretical basis  theorem of the central limit 2 1 modelling the process use of theoretical or empirical models to identify the measurement procedure  correlation uncertainty  iso gps standards  2 2 evaluation of uncertainty type a and type b uncertainty contributes  iso gum  2 3 determining expanded uncertainty uncertainty propagation and relevant degrees of freedom 2 4 critical points independent variables correlation  non linearity  asymmetry of probability distributions 3 uncertainty table practical method for evaluating uncertainty 4 typical examples applications to case studies on measurement  mechanical design and production process planninglectures by visiting lecturers and personal study casestatement of uncertainty is mandatory by current quality standards  starting from iso 9001 and  more specifically  iso 17025  that governs management of testing and measurement laboratories  a fundamental reference text on this topic has been published by iso   guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement   currently referred to as  the gum  and embodied into the env 13005 european standard  statistical procedures dictated by gum cover a broad range of applications  besides definition of such a delicate undertaking as evaluation of measurement uncertainty with a clear set of rules accepted worldwide  they cater for planning measurement and testing work aimed at specific levels of uncertainty  in order to avoid failure to reach required accuracy  and costly overdesign  these methods   covering both specific metrological work  such as e g  calibration of sensors and instrument systems  and generic testing work  also deal with applications in the activities of design and planning of production processes  the objectives of this course are to describe the main methods to be adopted and to present some applications in the field of measurement  design and production engineering the phd course is based on very short presentations by the teacher and ample discussions with students that beforehand have read relevant papers  the course couples lectures and activities on measurement uncertainty evaluation with practical cases  students are invited to present simple case studies involving their activity with measurement  mechanical design and production engineering for a discussion and further analysis using the methods described in the course
