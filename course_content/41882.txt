the course introduces students to engineering work under arctic conditions  and provides tools for understanding infrastructure and construction projects as sociotechnical processes  in the course  there is more focus on societal conditions and the changes that infrastructure projects entail than on construction technology  the course thus gives engineering students the opportunity to relate already acquired technical competencies to infrastructure projects in a specific arctic context  key elements    social conditions in the arctic   socio technical and social science approaches to infrastructure and society in the arctic   infrastructure and its importance for local development with links to global dynamics   stakeholder and actor analyses   sustainable local and regional development   strategic planning   logistics in the arctic  the course will be based on group work  in each group there will be members with different backgrounds    the course uses primarily local examples from greenland  and will involve local actors  but examples from the arctic region in general will also be included   the competences obtained in this course will be of general value  since the focus is on developing adapted solutions based on local conditions lectures  guest lectures  group work  visits  and project workto provide knowledge and proficiency to understand and analyse how infrastructure  business development  and settlement patterns are connected in arctic communities and landscapes course in greenland as part of the arctic semesterthe course takes place in sisimiut  greenland  the course will normally be part of the arctic semester in greenland together with 11857  11859 and 11853 or 11854  separate application for the semester to the department by 1 october    the course can be taken as a stand alone course under open university   the course could together with 11857 and 11859 be taken by bachelor students in their last semester e g  in combination with their bachelor project
