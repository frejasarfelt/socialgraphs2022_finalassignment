the term  ship operations  covers in its general use a wide field of disciplines within shipping and naval architecture  in this course  the term is restricted specifically to aspects dealing with a ship sailing in a seaway on open oceans  where the main problem relates to wave excitations of the ship  including motions  loads and fuel consumption   in particular  the focus is on performance monitoring and decision support systems  used to  respectively  monitor fuel efficiency  retrospectively  and guide crew in decisions focused on safety on board the ship  in real time   the course deals with a variety of topics  including seakeeping  human factors affecting ship operations  eedi  energy efficiency design index   full scale measurements  stochastic waves  ocean wave energy spectra  motion transfer functions lectures and guest lectures  exercises and project workthe aim of this course is to provide an understanding of the methods and analyses that form the basics of both performance monitoring  fuel efficiency  and decision support  safety  with regards to ship operations during sailing in a seaway  these techniques are used by naval architects and engineers in the technical departments of ship owners  in classification societies  and ship consultancies the course includes project work and reading of scientific papers   as part of the course  a  field visit  is often organised to a relevant company  e g  one of the classification societies  typically  the visit is made together with the other maritime msc courses
