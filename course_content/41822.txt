transducers and systems for determining of pressure  velocity  flow and temperature  flow visualization  signal analysis  data recording and processing  error theory  the theoretical basis is illustrated through two experiments in which typical fluid mechanical measuring systems are used  such as a hot wire anemometer and laser based methods lectures and experiments in the laboratory to give an introduction to  measuring techniques for determining velocity  flow  pressure  temperature etc  for fluids under stationary as well as nonstationary conditions  the course gives basic measurement theory and gives examples of physical interpretation of measurements  the course will give practical laboratory experience one day will take place at ris√∏ campus
