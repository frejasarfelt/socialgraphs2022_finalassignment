in the course the basic layout and function of heating systems and systems for mechanic and natural ventilation are gone through  the hydraulic background for pipes and ducts is covered   for heating systems the following is gone through    determination of radiator power and choice of radiator   layout and dimensions of pipe systems   plan and dimensioning of floor heating    selection of pumps and determination of their electric power consumption  for ventilation systems the following is gone through    the need for ventilation   ix diagram   mechanical ventilation    sizing of grilles and diffusers   layout and dimensions of duct systems   selection of air handling unit and the function of components in the unit   efficiency of heat recovery   electric power consumption in fans   natural ventilation    principles for natural ventilation   calculation of driving pressure and air flows   determination of size and placement of openings  during the course you work with projects where you size heating and ventilation systems for a building lectures and exercisesthe aim of the course is to make you able to design building services for heating and ventilation with regard to indoor climate  energy consumption and durability of the building   after the course you are able to design a simple heating system and systems for mechanical and natural ventilation  you are able to size radiators  pipes and pumps in heating systems  you are able to determine the need for ventilation from legal requirements and requirements for thermal indoor climate and air quality  for mechanical ventilation systems you are able to size grilles  diffusers and ducts and to choose a suiting air handling unit  for natural ventilation systems you are able to determine opening areas and their placement  you are able to calculate the energy consumption for pumps and fans included in the evaluation of the energy consumption of the building and to show that the demands in the building regulations are fulfilled re exam in august is placed as 5b
