the course will cover advanced product system modelling and construction and application of coupled parameterized product system models  you will learn how to conduct input output and hybrid lca in order to perform large scale assessments and for data gap filling  you will learn about characterization models and differences among recognized life cycle impact assessment methodologies  e g  recipe  ilcd  impact world   etc   and applying these on your own product system model  we will deal with model sensitivity and uncertainty  you will learn how to conduct sensitivity and uncertainty on your own product system and how to use this to aid interpretation of results  you will learn about absolute environmental sustainability assessment  aesa   you will be introduced to the different methodological steps needed to conduct an aesa  this includes identification and definition of absolute environmental boundaries  sharing of the safe operating space delimited by boundaries  characterization of impacts in metrics of the boundaries  estimating aesa results and evaluation of results to support decision making   you will apply the topics you are taught on a specific case study  you will be working on the same case throughout the course and using the different methods on this case  you will receive feedback on your case study work during the course  the assessment will be based on an overall assessment of mandatory written assignments based on the case study work  handed in during and at the end of the courselectures  exercises and case study workthe course is intended for students with lca expertise quantitative sustainability competencies as career targets    the course provides participants with the in depth knowledge and methods for performing lca and sustainability assessments of man made systems  such as products  companies or nations   the course will go into specific details related to more advanced lca and sustainability assessments  such as parameterized and dynamic life cycle inventory modeling  input output and hybrid lci modelling  sensitivity and uncertainty analysis  and absolute environmental sustainability assessments    the course will enable the participants to solve problems related to life cycle based environmental assessment of products and systems by application of internationally acknowledged standards  modelling approaches and accompanying tools
