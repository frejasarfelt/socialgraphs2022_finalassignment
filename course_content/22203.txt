the course covers a range of subjects necessary for successful conception  design  implementation and operation of healthcare products  the students will acquire fundamental insights into   1  disease diagnostics  modeling and therapy   2  the state of the art of healthcare products  and issues related to development and commercialization  such as patent  product validation  regulation   market analysis   3  procedures to conceive and design an innovative healthcare product  including idea formulation  methodologies  project planning and risk assessment   4  implementation of the project  i e   constructing the product  building prototype and demonstrating the functionalities   5  analytical statistics involving how to handle  calculate and understand the obtained data and results  we will work to target cells with a nanoparticle  drug delivery   visualise the nanoparticle  biosensing  and validate the drug targeting binding and biocompatibility through 3d tissue culturing  we expect that students work in a larger group addressing all three fields with sub groups of 2 3 student for each field the teaching is based on the conceive design implement operate approach  during the 13 weeks course  the teaching is a mixture of lectures  assignments and group work which facilitate the creative process of conceiving and designing a health care product  during the 3 weeks period  we go into the lab to implement the ideas  the three study lines have individual tracks in the course but excellence can only be achieved by collaborations between the different tracks lecture slides  notes and articles the main objective of the course is to provide students with the necessary tools used in innovation processes  the key to achieve this is team work and cooperation between teams  during the course  the students will gain deep working knowledge and conceptual understanding of various health technologies  drug delivery particles  biosensing and tissue models  by learning technical fundamentals  they will also learn to create and operate new healthcare products  processes and systems  moreover  it is our aim that the students understand the importance and the strategic impact of research and technological development on society msc students at advanced materials and healthcare engineering have first priority
