the course gives an introduction to the governing navier stokes equations and their solution using the finite volume method  the course presents solution procedures for the velocity pressure coupling for explicit and implicit time discretization schemes  direct and iterative solution procedures for the linearized equations are discussed  the focus of the course is application of the commercial cfd package  star ccm  for practical problems in fluid mechanics   computational fluid dynamics  cfd  is the numerical analysis of fluid motion  heat transfer and associated phenomena  it involves the formulation of the governing partial diffential equations describing the transport of mass  momentum and heat  and a discretiation of these equations using finite difference  finite volume or finite element methods  for engineering applications the finite volume discretization is often method of choice as it allows simulations of fluid flow in complex geometries with a minimum requirement of computer memory and execution time  the course will outline the steps required for the spatial and temporal discretization of the governing equations using finite volumes and describe techniques for the solution of the discrete set of equations   the participants may bring their own  star ccm   flow problem for the exercises in the 3rd week of the course morning lectures afternoon exercisesferziger and peric computational methods for fluid dynamics  springer  2002the course give an introduction to the theory of computational fluid dynamics  cfd  and focus on the practical application of the commercial cfd package star ccm
