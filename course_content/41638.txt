the course focuses on quantification of costs of complexity and development of initiatives for reduction of complexity  as well as quantification of expected reduction of costs from implementing the initiatives  furthermore it is explained how these freed resources can be applied to develop new products and to increase the revenue on profitable customers and products  the assignment begins with an analysis of the product s features and separation of products into a  80     b  15    and c  5    categories in relation to turnover and contribution margin  after this  costs of complexity are being quantified  and allocated to the individual products  based on an analysis of profitability and costs of complexity for products and product families  initiatives are developed for reduction of costs of complexity  the expected reduction of costs for the initiatives is quantified  and a plan is made for implementation project work  lectureswilson  s a   perumal  a   2009  waging war on complexity costs  1st ed  mcgraw hill  europe management of complexity is crucial for successfull development of products and business processes  to avoid superfluous complexity in products and processes the innovation process needs to include an analysis and synthesis of complexity and the impact of complexity  furthermore the impact of complexity must be quantified in terms of impact on costs  delivery performance  flow in production  quality etc  in this course we focus on quantification of costs of complexity  the course objective is to give students competencies and operational skills to analyse and quantify complexity costs in a company  furthermore  the course aims at achieving an understanding of the basic principles of complexity management  and how to apply these principles when making strategy for products and processes  learning takes place through project work  where operational skills within analysis and quantification of complexity costs are learned
