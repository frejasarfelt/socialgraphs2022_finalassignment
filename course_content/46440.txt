there will be preliminary experiments to demonstrate relevant manufacturing methods used for assessment and choice of method and process parameters for the given component  the group should set up a plan for the experimental work and realization of the subject within the frame of the course  an introduction to basic design criteria for fiber composites will be given  calculation of the stiffness of the composite will be compared with the specific stiffness of the test subjects to assess the plan for the manufacture of composite items  thus  students will be able to explain the necessary quantity of material and plan a manufacturing process based on relevant process parameters mainly as exercises and laboratory workbased on the production of a selected component  a review is given of materials and methods of manufacture of advanced fiber composites with polymer matrix combined with a review of methods of control of material quality  focus will be on manufacturing and control of advanced fiber composites  i e  fiber composites with high content of long direction oriented fibers  matrix materials will be thermosetting for manufacturing by vacuum infusion or autoclave consolidation of a prepreg material  composites based on thermoplastic matrix materials can be manufactured by press consolidation registration can only be made after contacting christen malte markussen   cmar dtu dk   no later than 1st of november 2022 the course can be aimed at groups of students who want to realize a concrete composite component in connection with for example the dtu eco or wind car  the mold s  for the manufacture of the composite component and necessary composite materials have to be established by the students before the course begins the course is held in the fiber laboratory at ris√∏ campus in roskilde  for security reasons  all handling of thermosetting matrix will be undertaken by the staff
