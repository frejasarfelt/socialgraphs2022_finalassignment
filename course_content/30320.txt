the course is sectioned into two parts  the lecture hours  where the theory  standards and methods are taught  and a laboratory part  where teams of students form study groups that solve practical assignments    these assignments are all derived from the international satellite projects in which the department participates  why it is the intention that the designs are to be used for later missions  therefore  the assignments include both system engineering  robustness and space hardening aspects  as well as instrumentation aspects lectures and laboratory work on teams 1 afternoon pr  week  lectures in 2a and exercises in 2b to enable the student to design and verify complex aero space instrumentation systems  the course emphasizes standard design drivers such as quality  precision  longevity  robustness and industrial norms and standards  to enable conceptual verification  the students must realize critical parts of their designs in the laboratory  the theories  techniques and methods learned are common to aerospace  medico techniques  military electronics  robotics etc at the start of the semester  the students will be presented with a problem complex  i e   that year s topic  the students will be asked to form teams that together cover the field in such a way that the problem complex is well covered  each student will join a team based on experience  personal preferences  education and skills
