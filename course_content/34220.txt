modern communication and cyber systems use one or more instances of coding and the goal of this course is to provide an introduction to such coding systems  the present course has an application perspective supported by practical exercises and projects  which may be executed in matlab and possibly python programming  the theories for coding systems are quite deep and these issues are treated in several other dtu courses  the course contains the following subjects   	channel coding  error correction   	linear block codes  principles  hamming  rs  and bch from a user perspective  	convolutional codes  encoding and decoding  viterbi   	source coding  data compression   	the entropy concept  	huffman coding  	use of linear prediction of signals  	video and image coding  	mpeg and jpeg  	cryptography  safeguarding and protection of information   	classical block cryptography  	mceliece s crypto system the lectures use detailed slides which form the basic course material  for each lecture one or more exercises are carried out  the exercises usually require programming in matlab and often use of tools from the matlab toolboxes  the course will introduce matlab  at the end of the course  a small project on a subject chosen by the student is to be carried out and a report should be handed in lectures  exercises and project workto provide an introduction to coding in communication systems and cyber technology   	error correcting coding for communication channels  	coding of information sources for data compression  	encryption of information to safeguard the content the course is introductory and many advanced courses are offered in these subjects  it is assumed that the students bring a laptop computer and have access to programming in matlab  python or c c
