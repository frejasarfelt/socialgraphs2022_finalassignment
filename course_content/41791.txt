the course will focus on the fundamental principles of nanotribology illustrated by a number of applications    list of lecture topics     	introduction to nanotribology with a state of the art overview of the stage of the research    	nanotribological contact mechanics which are the basics of the research area    	nanotribological simulations  e g  molecular dynamics  and theories  computer modelling    	an example of nanotribological experimental method  the atomic force microscope  afm     	a number of applications including    	nanotribological investigations of the lubricity of dimethyl ether  dme  at dtu    	theory of rubber friction at the nano scale with applications to the tire and the medical industry    	friction of polymers with application to the medical industry    	micro nano processing  a research area at dtu    the content of the course will be adapted to the most recent and interesting research every year  the most prominent researchers in the field will teach the studentsinvited lecturers and project workthe course is for phd students having surfaces in contact and in relative motion as a part of their scientific topic  it is the case for nearly all phd students   the course enables the students to evaluate tribology on the nano scale  which provides a link between macro  and nanomechanisms in friction  lubrication and wear the course material consists of about 30 journal articles covering the topics of the course  the paper should be read before the start of the course  this adds about one week work time to the course
