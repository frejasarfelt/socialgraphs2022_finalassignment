partial differential equations  pde  on weak form  implementation of pdes in the finite element method software comsol multiphysics  numerical convergence analysis  governing equations for scalar and vector fields in mechanics  thermodynamics  quantum mechanics  electromagnetism  elektrokinetics  acoustics  and optics  progression in the complexity of the problems from one scalar field  via one vector field  to coupled scalar and vector fields  as well as from 2d to 3d lectures  problem sessions  and project assignmentlecture notesto enable the student to solve a broad selection of the fundamental partial differential equations of mathematical physics using the finite element method software comsol multiphysics the course requires the student to install the software comsol multiphysics on his her personal laptop  comsol multiphysics can be acquired from  dtu software download  at the dtu g bar  and it must be installed and checked before the first lecture of the course
