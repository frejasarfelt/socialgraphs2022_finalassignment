the course introduces the theoretical background and history of railway signalling systems  the theoretical part of the course introduces the signal equipment  interlocking systems and their instrumental relation to traffic control  different types of signalling systems will be introduced  including the european rail traffic management system  ertms  and the communications based train control  cbtc   during the course and correlated with the theoretical presentations  focus will be put on the design and evaluation of signalling systems through periodic required exercises  the course is comprised of lectures by local staff and guest lectures from external consultancy  a field trip  to study infrastructure elements and traffic control  could be integrated in the plan  but can not be guaranteed a priori  since it depends on external stakeholders possibilities lectures  self tuition  exercises and project work in groupsgregor theeg   sergey vlasenko  railway signalling   interlocking  isbn 978 3 7771 0394 5  additional reading materials will be provided during the coursethe purpose of the course is to illustrate the integrated operation of railway systems in regards to dispatching  signalling and interlocking and the technologies enabling it  the course aims at establishing a basic understanding of functional subsystems  technological principles and differential evolutionary technical developments  which can be applied for the evaluation and declaration of design rules  analysis and design of signalling and interlocking infrastructure elements for railways
