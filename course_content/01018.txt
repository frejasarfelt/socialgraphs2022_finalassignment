algebra is the foundation of many applications  especially in coding theory and cryptography  the goal with this course is to introduce several algebraic constructions  groups  rings and fields   these constructions will be exemplified in different areas  among others geometry and discrete mathematics  also an impression is given as to how this theory is applied and as such the course is a preparatory course for further courses in discrete mathematics lectures and exercise sessionscourse notes will be made available on campusnet the goal with this course is to introduce several algebraic constructions  specifically  groups  rings and fields   these constructions will be exemplified in different areas  among others geometry and discrete mathematics  apart from this  the course strengthens the ability to formulate and carry out a mathematical proof as well as to handle mathematical concepts
