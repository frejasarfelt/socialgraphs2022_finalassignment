we introduce the concepts of energy system analysis and scenario building  in lectures  exercises and project work the students gradually learn how to build scenarios and analyse future large scale energy systems  as well as assess energy system analyses performed by others  the gams based tool  balmorel  will be applied as an exemplary model the course consists of lectures  exercises and a group project assignment  the students learn to develop future energy scenarios and undertake energy system analyses of these scenarios with the balmorel tool the main purpose of the course is for the students to learn how to perform analysis of future energy system scenarios
