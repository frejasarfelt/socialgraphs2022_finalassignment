lectures and group work will cover a broad range of subjects  main type catalysts and catalytic effects  preparation methods  reaction kinetics  process design  characterization techniques and structure and reactivity of model catalysts and industrial catalysts  furthermore  a number of concepts of green and sustainable chemistry will be dealt with in relation to environmentally benign energy and chemicals production  e g  multi phase catalysis and alternative reaction media  the project part in the course will to a large extent be linked to the research performed at the centre for catalysis and sustainable chemistry at the department of chemistry lectures and group work  together with course 26510  as well as projects where litterature studies led to contemplation in selected catalytic processes and technology from the chemical industry  the projects are concluded with an individual dissemination presentation an interdisciplinary course which will give students a fundamental understanding of various main type catalysts  and knowledge of principles and methodologies applicable to obtain ressource effecient and sustainable chemical reactions  the student will also acquire knowledge on how different main type catalysts are synthesized  characterized on the nanometer scale and tested for catalytic activity  thus allowing the student to establish structure performance relationships  furthermore  will the student obtain detailed knowledge  on the catalytic technology within selected processes from the chemical industry the course will not be offered in 2022 and 2023
