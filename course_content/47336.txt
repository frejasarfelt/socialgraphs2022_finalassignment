introduction to large scale facilities as synchrotrons and spallation sources for x ray and neutron production  the principles of x ray and neutron scattering  soft and hard materials in relation to scattering  reflectometry  small angle scattering  crystal and powder diffraction  x ray absorption spectroscopy  inelasting scattering  imaging  tour of maxlab and ess  writing a beamtime application lectures  computer exercises with theory and data analysis  laboratory exercises   safety in the lab is part of the course  the course will be evaluated during the course period elementary scattering theory  for x ray and neutron users  d s  sivia  oxford university press  illustrated edition  2011  and  supplementary material two of the world s most powerful microscopes are placed in lund  one is the x ray facility max iv  which is already in use  and the other is the neutron facility european spallation source  ess   the overall goal of this course is to get acquainted with this type of advanced microscopy techniques  how you apply these and how you get access to these types of large scale international facilities  these facilities are widely used by universities and industry for advanced analysis of materials and devices  we will work with x ray and neutron scattering on both soft and hard materials for applications in biology  chemistry  physics and related materials  energy  biomedical  and life science technologies  we will work with the basic experimental techniques  small angle scattering  crystal and powder diffraction  inelastic scattering  x ray absorption spectroscopy and imaging   the course is highly cross disciplinary and involves participants from the whole Ã¸resund region  which will give rich opportunities for networking you will learn how to apply large scale x ray and neutron microscopes  cross disciplinary course for the non expert  includes x ray experiments in dtu s 3d imaging center and at dtu energy
