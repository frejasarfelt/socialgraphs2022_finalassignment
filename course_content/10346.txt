introduction of velocity field and pressure field   hydrostatic problems with special focus on surface tension  strain and stress in elastic media  the equations for linear elasticity  bending and buckling  ideal  incompressible fluid motion  the euler equation    viscosity and navier stokes equation  potential flow theory and surface waves  boundary layers   vortices  hydrodynamical instabilities  creeping flows the weekly block of four hours will consist of a mixture of lectures  work with problems and computer exercises  central in the course are two  larger homework problems  which are graded and count as part of the final grade  the homework problems are new from year to year and each assignment focuses on a selected problem of current research interest benny lautrup  physics of continuous matter  exotic and everyday phenomena in the macroscopic world  second edition  crc press  taylor and francis group  2011  isbn   9781420077001the aim of the course is to give the student a basic understanding of the physics of spatially extended media consisting of solid materials  liquids  and gasses  the course can be regarded as a natural extension of classical mechanics  including thermodynamics statistical mechanics  or be the basis for more specialized studies in elasticity  hydrodynamics  microfluidics  biophysics  and complex systems continuum physics  10346  and theoretical microfluidics  10337  are independent  the courses only overlap in the introduction to the fundamental fluid dynamics equations
