the global fisheries annually catch an astonishing amount of c  100 million tons of fish  in the north sea alone  between 30 and 40  of the biomass of commercially exploited fish is removed each year by fisheries  in the course  we will study how fisheries scientists assess the size of these fish stocks to produce biological fisheries advice and examine the role of the international council for the exploration of the sea  and to a lesser extent other international advisory bodies   the lectures have a global perspective  but with a particular focus on the north east atlantic  topics covered in the course involves  1  data collection   2  models of growth  mortality and recruitment   3  stock assessment models and catch predictions   4  multispecies models   5  ecological impact of fishing   6  recreational fishing   7  marine protected areas   8  introduction to fisheries management  the students will be applying simple mathematical models in r  the student don t need prior knowledge of r  and will be acquainted with full scale state of the art operational assessment models  the students will be producing two small reports  for the first report  the students freely choose a fisheries related topic that they find interesting  they identify a problem and propose a solution  the second report  is a pre defined assignment  where the students will be asked to make a stock assessment and produce advice for a given fish stock  to ensure a balance between conventional approaches  recent development  and the newest pioneering ideas and trends  a suite of researchers from dtu aqua have been connected to the course and will give lectures on the diverse topics  in addition  we will be discussing recently published scientific articles lectures  individual and group exercises  analytical exercises are mainly conducted in r   home assignments  read scientific articles and produce two small reports  jennings  s   kaiser  m   reynolds  j d   2001  marine fisheries ecology   blackwell science    copies of overheads and selected papers to provide the participants with an understanding of  1   the biological background and data requirements of stock assessments and fisheries advice   2  how to apply  in r  some of the most commonly used quantitative models   3  the diversity of disciplines and approaches relevant to fisheries  and  4   the global scale of fisheries and its interactions with the ecosystem this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  12  responsible consumption and production    13  climate action  and  14  life below water
