this three week project comprises monte carlo simulations of radiation dosimetry and experimental work  the project relates to current research issues in medical applications of ionizing radiation  accelerator dosimetry  or metrology  the computations can normally be carried out using the students  own computers  the course consists of the following elements   i  lectures  details about the monte carlo code such as egsnrc and the theoretical basis for radiation dosimetry    ii  studying literature related to the project problem  e g  research papers    iii  obtaining physical parameters for the computations   iv  measurements and experiments   v  modelling   vi  student presentations  and  vi  report writing lectures and projectsoftware manuals iaea course materialthe main objective of this course is to carry out a project involving monte carlo simulations and experimental work within the field of dosimetry of ionizing radiationdepending on the number of students  if may be necessary to split the class into groups   first week  lectures on dosimetry and the monte carlo tecnique  installation of the software using egsnrc or topas geant4 on a virtualbox running the linux operating system  define and select project  the application of topas requires that an agreement can be reached with the consortium behind this software   second week  measurements and computations  last week  supplementary measurements and computations  as well as report writing   the experimental facilities can be found using the link  www mrdc dtu dk egsnrc link  https   nrc cnrc github io egsnrc  topas link  http   www topasmc org
