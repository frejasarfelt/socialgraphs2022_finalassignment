the course comprises of three blocks  fundamentals  practical systems  and applications  the  blocks cover the following topics    primers  review of laser essentials and overview of ultra short light pulses    generation and modelling of ultrafast laser pulses    dispersion of ultra short pulses and pulse compression techniques   measurement techniques for ultrafast pulses  correlation methods and full electric field    reconstruction    evolution of chirped pulse amplification   parametric amplification and frequency conversion   carrier envelope phase stability  few cycle pulses and optical frequency combs    modern ultrafast laser systems   ultrafast mid infrared and thz sources    hot topics in ultrafast science  including ultrafast thz spectroscopylectures  demonstrations  in class exercises and quizzes  problems  and student presentations to understand the fundamental physics and technology of ultrafast lasers and gain an appreciation of how they are enabling cutting edge basic science and having a disruptive impact on specific industrial applications with high commercial potential  specifically  the course considers how ultrafast pulses are generated  how they propagate  how we can measure them  their interaction with matter  and how they can be used to interrogate materials to reveal dynamic processes that evolve on natural time scales equivalent to the motion of constituent electrons an introduction to ultrafast lasers with an outlook on state of the art high intensity  coherent light sources from the terahertz  thz  to extreme ultraviolet  xuv  spectral range  and their applications in measurements at the forefront of photonics  materials science  physical chemistry and nanotechnology
