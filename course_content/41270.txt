the course content is the following  	freight market for shipping  	cost involved in ship design  production  operation  maintenance and scrapping  	life cycle analysis  	energy consumption for propulsion  cooling  heating etc  	exhaust emissions from ships  	energy efficiency design index  eedi   	ship energy efficiency management plan  seemp   	cost benefit analysis  the students will be divided into groups  each group will be given a specific trade in terms of cargo type  amount of cargo and route  an optimal conceptual ship design shall be made by each group including a risk assessment taking into account the uncertainties in the input parameters lectures  project workthe aim of the course is to provide tools for an economic and environmental evaluation of ship transportation  during the course an optimal ship design is sought for a specific trade through minimization of the total life cycle cost including production of the vessel  operation and maintenance and  finally  scrapping   the total cost includes environmental and political issues and a risk assessment is made to quantify the effects of uncertainties in the input parameters   the course will give the students a commercial and strategic understanding of the governing parameters in running a shipping company
