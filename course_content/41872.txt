core elements   building foundations   building statics   building energy  installations and indoor climate  this course comprises of 3 main parts taught by different teachers   in foundations the students learn basics in geotechnics and dimensioning principles of building foundations with special focus on constructions on bedrock and permafrost   in statics we will explain methods for calculating forces on building structures of the house in order to evaluate whether the constructions are strong enough  loads from wind  snow and the unladen weight of the structure are converted into flat or line loads  these are distributed to the individual construction elements as construction loads  methods are taught for the distribution of these loads and the calculation of shear forces in structural elements in the form of bar and beam structures  and for strength testing by table look up   in building energy part of the course we discuss the construction details of building envelope and learn how to calculate heat losses and gains of a building  consequently the typical installations and their design are discussed  main focus is on heating and ventilation  additionally we address the issue of indoor environment and comfort   throughout the course we will use one case building on which students can practice the calculations and exercises   practical experiments as well as excursions will take place during the course   the final grade from the course is a weighted average of grades from individual parts  however  students must not fail neither of the parts in order to be qualified lectures with exercises and assignments  sub courses in energy and installations  indoor climate  statics and foundations the purpose of this course is to provide the students with design principles  calculations and evaluation tools used for designing houses in greenland  a specific focus is on foundations  statics  energy  installations and indoor climate this course is a part of arctic engineering education in sisimiut  greenland
