the course is rooted in the cdio principles  so that the students get through all the cdio phases in the project period from idea generation to a functioning functional model which is based on an electrical energy system   basic concepts related to power converting systems are touched upon  as well as complex power and voltage ratios  in addition to this  electrical machines and the transition to smartgrids are processed  subsequently  the focus is on basic converter topologies  including diodes  mosfets  capacitors  and coils analysis and design with a high degree of self motivation  the work is performed in groupsthe overall goal of the course is   to provide the student with a basic understanding of electrical energy systems  ranging from production  distribution and control of electrical energy to the construction of rectifier circuits with associated voltage supplies with or without galvanic separation   to train the student in project   group work  where work is done with all the cdio elements from idea generation to finished function model
