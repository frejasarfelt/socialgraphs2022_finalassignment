the course is divided into 2 parts  where all groups will start by preparation of linear polymers by both suspension as well as emulsion polymerization  subsequently each group select a specialization track  where a deeper insight into common techniques can be achieved  these change from year to year  but generally covers synthetic methods for preparation of polymers block copolymers  free radical polymerization  controlled radical polymerization  ring opening polymerization or e g  enzymatic polymerization   it could also be polymerization of bio based monomers   preparation of network polymers  preparation and testing of composites as well as surface modification and characterization   in all tracks the groups will work with purification and characterization of polymers  analysis of prepared polymers by sec  ft ir  nmr  dsc  tga and rheology  structure elucidation based on the performed analyses   finally the experiments should be documented and  reported in a scientific manner and presented through a poster session laboratory excercises and presentationsto practice experimental techniques applied in common polymerization methods such as suspension  emulsion  controlled free radical or ring opening polymerization and to achieve practical experience in characterization of polymers both chemically and physically
