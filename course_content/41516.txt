the relation between stresses and strains in elastic anisotropic materials   together with rotational transformations of consitutive models are presented  determination of elastic properties of composites  the necessary theory to analysis deflections  failure  stability and vibrations of fiber composite plates is presented  the course treats anisotropic materials like glass  carbon and aramid fiber reinforced polymers   the course content is equally distributed between theoretical methods for analysis and the application of these methods in design based on criteria for stiffness and strength  own computational tools are developed lectures  exercises and project work   exercises and project work are performed in groups of 2 students to give the student the necessary background for general anisotropic elasticity theory with special attention to analyses of structures made of fiber reinforced composites  to give the student the background to dimension laminate structures with respect to stiffness and strength
