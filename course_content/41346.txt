students will carry out classical as well as new ic engine experiments investigations with compression ignition and spark ignition engines  the experiments will include measurement control of engine speed  torque  cylinder pressure  friction  fuel and air consumption  ignition injection timing  gaseous and particulate emissions  the particular experiments will to widest possible extend be part of current research activities on sustainable fuels and emission reduction   the measurements enable students to characterize the engine performance in terms of traditional engine specifications like mean effective pressures  efficiencies  specific fuel consumption and specific emissions etc   in group work the experimental data will be analyzed with matlab  graphical illustrations of the analysis and their interpretations  is the main subject in the report writing    core elements    	matlab programming  	programming with structured databases   	heat release analysis based on cylinder pressure  	spectral analysis of cylinder pressure with fft  fast fourier transform   	digital signal filtering  	investigate and interpret results from variation of engine parameters  	graphical presentation of resultslectures  group work with laboratory exercises and reportsengine principles and vehicles  spencer c  sorensen  dtu book storethe purpose of the course is to give students with a theoretical ic engine background  the necessary experimental background to enable working with ic engines on a research and development level  the numerical treatment of acquired experimental data is considered as the major objective of the course  it is an important prerequisite for experimental projects with ic engines
