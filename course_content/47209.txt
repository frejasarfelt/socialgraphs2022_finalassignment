the course is based on project organized learning  throughout the course  the students will work in groups  each group is given a material which they will work with  in the groups  the students decide which information is relevant to extract from the 3d structure of their material  and what kind of modelling they would like to perform  in the lab  the groups will use an x ray ct scanner to record data that they reconstruct  segment and analyze  the last part of the analysis will be to apply modelling of physical properties of a material in 3d  to support the project organized learning  theoretical lectures  online material such as videos and small exercises will be given  the lectures and videos will describe the principles behind each practical step  x ray experiment  reconstruction  segmentation  analysis  modelling   the course provides students with a basic understanding of and skills to operate x ray ct scanners as well as relevant software for reconstruction and analysis  the students will exercise their skills in data analysis  across the groups  the students will interact by giving oral presentations and feedback project organized learning  lectures  oral presentations  group work  lab exercises  computer exercises   the course will be evaluated through the course period  relevant safety procedures will be introduced during the course all teaching material is free and online available ct scanners have become an important tool for imaging of 3d structures in many different materials  examples are quality assurance of building materials  of food  or of complex 3d design  for example produced by a 3d printer  in the health sector  ct scanners are often used for diagnosing  but new tools and drugs are also scanned when their 3d structures are important  micro  or nano ct scanners are more and more used within research and development of new materials  3d image analysis is also an interesting field under rapid development for applied mathematics and programming    this course is an introduction to anyone who would like to work with this technology  i e  with 3d imaging and analysis of 3d data  the course will educate users of advanced 3d x ray imaging methods and prepare students to work with 3d data   the students will in groups work with scanning and analyzing a material  in this work the groups will be guided through the following process  data acquisition in the lab  reconstruction of the acquired data  analysis of 3d data and modelling of physical properties  in this way  the students will achieve knowledge on the type of information that can be extracted from 3d data and how it is done in practice    the course will provide a basis for later individual project work  bsc  msc  phd  with 3d analysis in the direction in which the student is specializing this course is for any student who would like to use ct scanners for 3d imaging and analysis of the internal parts of materials
