today wind energy conversion takes place mainly on large scale using mw wind turbines  but the engineering physics and the aerodynamic principles are largely the same as for very small wind turbines  the idea is to build a wind powered car to drive as fast as possible in direct headwind or to build the best performing wind turbine  the students are initially introduced to the competitions  the theory for and mechanics of the existing car turbine  assignments targeted at highlighting key fundamental physics and behavior of both the wind car and turbine are solved by the students  in parallel with course lectures  previously built wind cars turbines are reviewed and based on new ideas   concepts  desing and construction of a new or part of a new wind car turbine is done  identified core issues for the car turbine structure are selected based on analysis of the aeromechanics and are solved in groups for each selected area  aerodynamics  wings  shroud  hub mechanics  transmission  control  instrumentation  electrical system  composite material  etc    the disciplines related to design and construction are for example  aerodynamics  machinery elements  fiber composite  experimental testing  etc  the design tasks are adapted to the prior knowledge and ambition of the students  a key objective is the integration of the various components into a functional and effective wind car turbine construction  prior to the competitions the developed designs are tested in the field project work  exercises and lecturesto introduce students to conversion of wind energy  specifically in relation to the fastest possible speed of a wind driven car or the best performance of a wind turbine  the objective is to let the students apply learned theory into practice in solving a design task leading to construction   improvement of a wind car wind turbine  the final goal is to participate in international competitions the course will take place in the spring and ends up with participation in either the international wind turbine racer competition  den helder  the netherlands  or the international small wind turbine competition the course is specifically aiming at designing and building for participating in international competitions on the fastest wind turbine powered car or the best performing wind turbine  the first part of the course consists of a series of lectures and assignments aimed at familiarizing the students with the key physics and technical issues involved for both windcar and wind turbine  armed with the knowledge and tools obtained in the first part  the students proceed to the last part of the course  where the student   group of students  3 5  identify a core issue for the vehicle s or turbine s structure design and thereafter plan and organize further activities to design  build  test and integrate the components
