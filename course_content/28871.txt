the course deals with biological conversion of different biomass resources into biofuels such as methane  hydrogen  ethanol  butanol  biodiesel  hybrid processes i e  gasification and subsequent biological gas fermentation are also included in the course in the context of bio based production of energy  the major elements of the course are  defining the concept of bioenergy production and sustainability  biomass characterization  mapping of biomass potential for biofuel production  microbial processes in relation to biofuels production  bottlenecks and inhibition effects and downstream processing  examples from both research and industry will be presented in order to put the above concepts into perspective   the course will provide the student with an overview of the biological processes that are used for conversion of biomass to biofuels  it focuses on fundamental biochemical concepts such as enzyme technology related to biomass composition and the use of enzymes for biomass degradation  thermodynamics and kinetics in relation to microbial growth and product formation and use of microorganisms for production of biofuels   the course will also include experimental project work and the students will be familiarized with the biomass to biofuel process through own obtained experimental data and calculations  this will form the basis of a written report where the production process will be designed and discussed lectures  exercises  laboratory exercises  group workthe course aims at qualifying the students to apply previously acquired basic knowledge in microbiology  biotechnology and process engineering to biological conversion of different kinds of biomass into biofuels by combining theoretical  lectures  and experimental  laboratory exercises  means  the focus will be on biomass availability  biofuels production processes and their feasibility  obstacles and possible solutions for the technical implementation of biofuel production from different biomass resources will be analyzed too   the course will also include experimental project work and the students will be familiarized with the biomass to biofuel process through own obtained experimental data and calculations dedication and commitment to own learning as well as to group work  is expected from the course participants  attendance to guest lectures  3 4  and excursion to a biogas plant are compulsory elements for this course
