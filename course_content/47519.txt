the transition of the energy sector from fossil based fuels and resources to renewable resources and energy will significantly change the energy system of the future  several technologies with different technology readiness levels are currently under development to make this transition happen  however  technical solutions and concepts still have to be developed and benchmarked against each other and existing technologies  but what are sustainable renewable resources and which technologies are sustainable in the long run  storing electrical energy in synthetically derived fuels and chemicals through so called  power to x  technologies is currently seen as an important and promising route ahead  a focal point is thus the increased electrification and the options for chemical energy storage and commodity chemical production  in a project based approach  the course will provide insight into the various technical concepts for synthetic fuels and chemicals based on renewable and bio resources   the course consists of lectures addressing the general concepts and methodologies as well as individual student projects  addressing selected topics related to the synthesis of sustainable fuels and chemicals  the students will choose a specific topic or research project of interest to be analyzed in more detail especially as regards the technical concept and the sustainability aspects  and the results will be presented and discussed in plenum the course will be using distance learning as well as group work with physical presence  lectures  exercises and group discussions will mostly be conducted via online streaming  while project work on special topics is expected to take place in physical meetings   the format of the final group presentations depends on the distribution of participants and can be either physical   online or in hybrid mode  to be agreed on during the course  the course will be evaluated during the course period the course will only use material that is available via dtu library  a literature list will be provided during the course the course will provide an overview of renewable and biobased resources and the pathways of utilizing them today as sustainable power to x technologies as well as an outline of  pathways for future integration into the energy system  the focus is on advances in state of the art and novel electrochemical technologies which provide a very efficient way of converting chemical into electrical energy and vice versa this course will provide knowledge about the various pathways for sustainable power to x technologies and will also give the participants a deeper insight into larger collaborative research and development projects in this area
