the need of efficient and climate friendly mobility is setting up new targets for planning modern transport infrastructure as a prerequisite to bring people and freight fast through regions  in and out of urban areas or across borders  in this context it can be seen that spatial planning schemes and strategies more and more involve a design of new rail transport infrastructure   the course will examine the practical application of track engineering principles  the course focuses on electrified railways  a sustainable transport solution  with emphasis on how to design the horizontal and vertical alignment  together with the catenary system in a cad program  taking into consideration the maintenance of the track design  furthermore  the course also provides important competences for cost and budgeting of a railway project in the different phases of construction  inauguration and daily operation  the course program includes a case of a railway track suitable for regional express trains running 200 km h  even faster long distance passenger trains  and heavy freight trains   as a part of the course an excursion will be arranged to visit a real railway construction site in order to achieve a better understanding of the elements of the railway infrastructure  additionally  it will be possible during the course to meet several experts within the rail transport industry   the course is taught in english lectures  self tuition  exercises and project work in groups of 2 or 3 free ocs book  introduction to ocs principals   link  http   www ocs4rail com the purpose of the course is to achieve competences within the field of design and maintenance of railways for high speed trains and freight   this includes track alignment  stations  traction current and power supply
