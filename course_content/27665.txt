based on particularly chosen lab on a chip systems  e g  for manipulation of cells and separation of biomolecules  and numerical simulation  and with an engineering approach  you will be able to apply physical models to design new lab on a chip systems  the course is not a theoretical microfluidics course  but basic theory of microfluidics  diffusion  ac electrokinetics and ac physics will be presented  so that you will be able to understand and validate the numerical results  the theoretical focus is therefore on important dimensionless numbers  simple calculations of expected flow velocities and diffusion times  order of magnitude calculations of forces etc  most theoretical exercises are coupled with similar numerical exercises  so that you can compare your simple calculations with comsol s results  you can expect to learn how to use comsol  with many practical exercises and  how to  troubleshooting teaching in the first 8 weeks is supervised group or individual work  with short lectures  where the basic theoretical knowledge is presented  before we embark on theoretical and numerical exercises  we will work with different concrete problems  and these will be handed in as three individual reports every 3rd week  the last 5 weeks of the course consist of project work in groups of two to three students within a lab on a chip problem  concluded by a written report and project presentations lecture notes  various relevant book chapters  the students that are interested in a thorough theoretical background can use the book by henrik bruus   theoretical microfluidics   oxforda lab on a chip system  loc  is a device that integrates and down scales one or several laboratory functions on a single micro chip  locs deal with the handling of extremely small fluid volumes  microfluidics  down to sub nano liters  and have channel dimensions in the regime from 1 millimeter to 100 nanometers   the general goal of the course is that you will be able to analyze  and model the mode of operation of some chosen lab on a chip systems with the help of simple calculations based on basic microfluidic theory  moreover  it is the goal that you will be able to numerically model and design new lab on a chip systems using comsol multiphysics  the course is therefore relevant for you that would like to learn how to use comsols many possibilities for modelling microfluidic systems with focus on mainly biology relevant applications this course will give you a practical experience with methods used for the design  modeling  and use of lab on chip systems that can be used in many different applications  moreover  you will get acquainted with the research activities at dtu bionengineering involving lab on a chip systems  finally  the course will give you a good starting point for subsequent interdisciplinary m sc  thesis work involving lab on a chip systems and their applications
