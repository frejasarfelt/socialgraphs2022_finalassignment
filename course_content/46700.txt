  power grid   ac circuits  3 phase systems  power considerations   components in the grid like transmission lines  cables  transformers  generators and more    power flows and tools for simulation   symmetrical faults  the topics from the text book can be supported by topics from related areas    in the project  a realistic problem will be defined and has to be solved by means of the numerical simulation program powerfactory  load flow  with graphical user interface a  lectures  and group  exercises in connection with the lectures b  assignments to be handed in every second week  c  power flow simulations  group projects  where the power system will be investigated by modelling of af minor  realistic grid  participation in the project and quality of the work will be evaluated by a number of peer to peer meetings glover  sarma and overbye   power system  analysis and design    supplementary materialto give basic understanding of the power system and the essential aspects having influence on issues like the future electrical power system  the students achieve knowledge about the power grid and the main components involved under production  transmission and distribution of electric energy  the main principles and numerical tools for grid calculations are treated and will give experience and confidence for use hereof   the course forms the base for further education within power engineering  but is in general useful for all students aiming at some specialization within electrical energy systems
