the course aims to provide a student centered  learning from bim  experience by enabling the learner to select one of three paths   1  develop modelling  analysis and evaluation skills in different proprietary software tools  with a focus on interoperability    2  to identify and evaluate specific open bim workflows and tools or  3  to develop their own open bim tools  the focus of the course is for participants to identify a specific are invited to work in groups and identify a specific use case that is of interest to them  possibly aligned to an issue you wish to explore in your thesis   a core concept of the course is to navigate and understand the ifc format for interoperable data exchange in the aec industry   furthermore  iso 19650 is introduced to provide a common frame for the students to model and contextualized their selected use cases  additional concepts include cde  bcf and linked data etc lectures  individual assignments  and group assignments the advanced building information modelling  bim  course provides an opportunity to focus on a specific bim use case that is of interest to you  you will be introduced to use cases from external companies and stakeholders of the built environment  but you are also welcome to identify your own  the course focuses on the ifc  industry foundation classes  as a data format and scaffolds your investigation of this format through different exercises  your first exercises will focus on extracting data from the ifc format and then writing rules to check the data in the ifc  the selected use case should build on your prior domain knowledge of the problem to be addressed  having identified the use case  the next stage is to identify the ifc classes that you could query to get the data you need for your use case  finally  you have the opportunity to build an openbim tool or workflow  you can choose for this to be added to the dtu byg github repository  the aim of which is to curate an open ecosystem of openbim tools and workflows  the work for each task is performed in groups the course is graduate studies based on 11031 and 11952 and requires as a minimum participants to master commonly used tools for building information modeling  computational engineering design and simulation  it is recommended to take this course early in the graduate programme
