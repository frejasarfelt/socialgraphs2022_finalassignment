phase portraits of linear systems  stability analysis including the hartman grobman theorem  stable  unstable and center manifolds  local bifurcation theory  theory of planar systems including poincar√© bendixon theorem   the mathematical techniques will be applied to problems from physics  chemistry  and biology lectures and classes this is the introductory course on dynamical systems offered at dtu  many models in science and engineering are differential equations describing the evolution of some variables  dynamical systems theory is the study of such evolution aiming to answer questions like  what is the long term dynamics  how does the system depend on parameters  these are very important questions in applications and hence dynamical systems theory is a very important topic in science and engineering  dynamical systems is also a fascinating field of mathematics as it combines most of the core mathematical disciplines  in particular  analysis and geometry  the course will lay the mathematical foundation for the following more advanced courses  01257 advanced modelling   applied mathematics  where the students get to apply dynamical systems theory to concrete problems in modelling 01621 advanced dynamical systems  global theory 01622 advanced dynamical systems with applications in science and engineering
