the product synthesis process  the basic properties of the product  structure  shape  material  dimension  and surface  methods for structure variance  product factors  production  assembly  quality  industrial design  operation  disposal  etc  product specification   computer tools for design  the drawing system  the design draft as an engineering design tool  standards for drawing  shape and position tolerances  commonly used machine elements  through a number of design exercises  the participants work with systematic methods for product synthesis  the participants will partly design their own parts and partly design with conventional machine elements  the exercises include use of outlines  design drafts  shop drawings  and assembly drawings  the course is terminated by an independent design project which is carried through to documentation  written and including drawings  of a product  throughout the course  the use of engineering design handbooks as professional tools is practised  in the long term  it is expected that all participants will get the opportunity to make drawing documentation by use of cad lectures and tutorialsto enable the participants to design technical products and work out the drawing documentation needed for production  the participants must know the various phases of the development of a product and be able to use methods for determination of the structure and shape of the product in accordance with a broad spectrum of criteria concerning production  conditions of operation  price  appearance  etc  furthermore  the participants must be able to use design drafts and proper standard machine drawing in the design process obligatory course for design and innovation studentsif the course is followed up by a bachelor project at the dtu mekanik k p section participants will acquire suffieient theoretical knowledge and practical skills to have basic engineering design competence
