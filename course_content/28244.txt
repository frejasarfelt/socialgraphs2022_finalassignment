the course is related to both chemical and mechanical engineering  as both of these types of engineers work with fuels and emissions   topics covered include thermal conversion of gaseous  liquid and solid fuels  pyrolysis  gasification  combustion   developed models are applied to practical systems  i e   gas turbines  motors  pulverized fuel combustors  fixed bed and fluid bed  as well as related industrial high temperature processes  the content of the course is relevant for developing sustainable high temperature processes and this will be illustrated in the course  the different systems are treated theoretically and the students solve larger  practically oriented problems during the course  for non chemical engineers  introductory material is presented at the start of the course lectures and problem sessions  2 larger course exercisesto provide the participants with a fundamental knowledge about combustion and other high temperature processes  including formation and reduction of harmful emissions
