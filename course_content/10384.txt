the concept of quantum information will be introduced and discussed  starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics  superpositions  unitary transformations  and measurements   qubit states  entangled states  and mixed states will be rigorously discussed  quantum information protocols such as quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation will be introduced  bell s inequality will be discussed and tested in the lab  another subject is quantum computing which includes the discussion of different single and two qubit gates as well as various algorithms including shor s factoring algorithm  the different physical technologies for the implementation of quantum information processing will be discussed  finally  there will be hands on computational exercises on programming a quantum computer  either by simulation or over the cloud lectures and problem solvingthe laws of nature at the quantum scale are different than the laws of classical physics experienced in everyday life  this difference can be exploited to improve  information processing tasks and to enable new ones which are otherwise impossible  one striking example is the possibility for quantum computers which can solve certain tasks exponentially faster than any traditional computer  the aim of this course is to introduce you to the theory of quantum information  to give you an understanding of different quantum information protocols including quantum cryptography  quantum teleportation  and quantum computing  and to give you a few hands on experiences with state of the art quantum technology locally and through cloud services due to travelling  up to 5 lessons may be held online
