the course starts with advective and diffusive transport  and monte carlo simulation of a molecule in flow  we then turn to brownian motion and stochastic integrals  and establish the ito integral  we define stochastic differential equations  sde s   and cover analytical and numerical techniques to solve them  we describe the transition probabilities of solutions to sde s  and establish the forward and backward kolmogorov equations  including boundary conditions boundary behavior  we consider stochastic filtering in sde s with discrete time measurements  stochastic stability  and stochastic control  the theory is illustrated with applications in engineering  physics  biology  and oceanography lectures and exerciseslecture notes  u h  thygesen  lecture notes on diffusion and stochastic differential equations   supplementary literature is b  Ã¸ksendal  stochastic differential equations  an introduction with applications  springer  2010 the course connects the theory of molecular diffusion with the theory of differential equations driven by noise  it enables the student to build and examine models of how noise and uncertainty propagates in dynamic systems  this can be used for time series analysis  of for dynamic decision making under uncertainty  i e  stochastic control  the course contains theory for stochastic differential equations  stochastic calculus  and applications to engineering problems the course may be offered also at ph d  level  contact the course responsible person for details
