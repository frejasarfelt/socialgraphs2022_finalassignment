architectural engineering requires that we not only design solutions to built environment challenges  but also that we can identify the existing problems and design a test to see if our solutions address them    this course provides a framework to support learners to  1  identify existing built environment engineering challenges   2  synthesise solutions to address these based on the  3  development of tests to assess the appropriateness of the proposed solution to the identified challenge   the course seeks to motivate participants by introducing agile prototyping approaches and supporting them to work in groups to identify the problem  test and solution  to further support motivation and relevance  external companies contribute to the identification of potential challenges  but students are welcome to identify their own and provide external context and feedback on their work where possible   the course builds on students  prior domain knowledge of the problem to be addressed and then invites them to identify any further required learning  students then design a test to satisfy the proposed prototype  the form of the prototype should be appropriate to the identified challenge but could for instance be a digital tool for design or analysis  or a physical prototype of a building component or a hybrid or interface of these lectures  individual assignments  and group assignments architectural engineering requires that we can not only design solutions but also identify what the problem is and test if our solution addresses it  this course provides a learning experience wherein participants identify a specific use case   scenario in the built environment that they want to address  external companies will contribute candidate challenges for you to consider  but you are welcome to identify your own challenges  the course builds on your prior domain knowledge of the problem you are addressing and identify any further required learning  participants can then design a test to satisfy the proposed prototype  the form of the prototype should be appropriate to the identified challenge  but could for instance be a digital tool for design or analysis or a physical prototype of a building component for instance or a hybrid or interface for   of these  you will work in groups for the tasks the course will introduce the design science research methodology  agile design  prototyping  digital development methods and test driven development  the focus will be on the collaborative and agile development of an innovative prototype to identify a specific issue  the issue could be one from an external company or from a shared interest of the students in the group  it is expected that the issues will be explored from ideally from a holistic  digitalization  sustainability etc   angle  your perspective should also be considered in your defined test  the form of prototype could be digital  physical or hybrid  it is an important component of the course for the students to identify this early on in the course  the course will be completed with a report documenting the process followed by the students
