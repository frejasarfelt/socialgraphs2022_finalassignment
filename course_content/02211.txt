review of pipelining and caches  instruction level parallelism  chip multiprocessing  network on chip  time predictable computer architecturelectures and projectj  l  hennessy and d  a  patterson  computer architecture  a quantitative approach  current edition  morgan kaufmann publishing co   menlo park  ca    in addition to the textbook  this course includes a number of readings from research papers computer architecture  the art and science of designing hardware  is an exciting and fast changing research and development field  in this course we intend to transfer this excitement to the students   students will learn the organization and design of contemporary processor architectures  the foundations such as instruction set  pipelining  and memory hierarchies are reviewed  we will cover advanced concepts such as instruction level parallelism  out of order execution  and chip multiprocessing  as the current trend in computer architecture is towards chip multiprocessing  the architecture of shared memory multiprocessors and chip level interconnect  network on chip  will be a central focus of the course   most processors  99    are used in embedded systems  and many of those embedded systems are real time systems  therefore  processors need to be designed in a way that worst case execution time analysis is feasible  we will cover current research in the field of time predictable architectures students will work in groups  of two or three on a hardware or software lab project  a hardware project can be building a pipelined design in an fpga  software projects will explore embedded chip multiprocessor programming and programming models  besides a working solution  students will prepare a conference style paper on their project  the project and paper will be presented in class  exceptional projects shall lead to publications in computer architecture conferences
