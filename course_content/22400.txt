the living system and the goal for using it defines how the bioreactors are constructed  therefore  a clear description of the bioreactors  the living system and their intended usage must exist before the prototyping can start  the prototyping involves designing and building subsystems that measure e g  oxygen  turbidity  number of copepods  density of algae etc  this information will form the basis of how the bioreactor is controlled such as feed of nutrients and temperature in accordance with the needs of the living system in the bioreactor  the respective subsystem will subsequently be integrated into a device  a multi parametric sensor system is desirable to implement as growth of living organisms is dependent on many factors  ph  temperature and number of predators etc   there is however large freedom to choose between number of sensors and how to use the data to control the system  the students need to decide which parameters to use in order to sustain the living system and to reach the purpose of the bioreactor in the most efficient way  students may explore possibilities to control and take measurements remotely via web servers    the students will work in large teams  up to 8 people   each team is put together according to the students  respective engineering profiles  a successful team has as broad a knowledge base as possible to meet the multidisciplinary tasks of the project  the project will be led by the students themselves so that they learn how to work in a large team where each team consists of persons with different engineering profiles  each team will be assisted by a senior teacher to guide them on the management aspects of the project the course is a laboratory course that mainly require students to design and build an autonomous system to control and study a given living system  it is expected that students work 8h day in the laboratory teaching hours  tutorials  and lesson notes  the internet will be used as a source of information a bioreactor is typically used for production  water cleaning but also to model small ecosystems  bioreactors are therefore central for research and industry  the objective is to  prototype   that is design and build  a device that can  1  investigate some parameters in the bioreactor  e g  ph  oxygen  turbidity  salinity  cell growth etc    2  to use these parameters to regulate the feed of medium water nutrients to the bioreactor and 3  to model the resulting culture  the objective is also to get experience with using various eukaryotes such as algae  copepods and shrimps  the projects will be cross disciplinary and require close collaboration between team members to succeed   therefore  an important objective is to apply project planning  and labour division strategies only available for general engineering studentsstudents should bring a  64 bit  computer for programming embedded systems
