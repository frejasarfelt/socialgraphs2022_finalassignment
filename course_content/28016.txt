differentiability and linearization  the development of steady state and non steady state differential mass  and energy balances  mathematical models for systems with chemical and biochemical reaction  including enzymatic processes  together with convective and diffusive mass  and heat transport  the formulation of boundary conditions  ordinary differential equations and systems of such equations  the application of maple  laboratory exercise with model formulation lectures and project workfor an engineer it is important to analyse practical problems by simplified models  each of which simulates different aspects of the problem  in the course  the students learn to formulate models for simple chemical and biochemical systems  furthermore  the students must obtain knowledge and capabilities within a number of central mathematical concepts and methods in order to solve the models analytically or by approximate methods the course is only given in danish
