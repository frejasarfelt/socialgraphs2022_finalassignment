the course consists of an introduction to the use of large scale neutron and x ray facilities  such as the european spallation source  ess  and the max iv synchrotron  both in lund  sweden  and the european x ray free electron laser  e xfel  in hamburg   the basic theory of scattering and absorption of x rays and neutrons is introduced and the course participants gain familiarity with some of the most typical applications of laboratory x ray and large scale synchrotron x ray and neutron facilities  single crystal diffraction  powder diffraction  small angle scattering  imaging tomography and neutron spectroscopy    exercises  each student carries out selected laboratory exercises  in the second week of the course x ray experiments are carried out at an international large scale facility  max iv   the main focus of all exercises will be on hard and soft condensed matter science and material science    the course is concluded by data analysis  completion of exercise reports  preparation of posters and examination lectures and practical exercises in a three week periodthe course provides a practical introduction to characterization of materials using x ray and neutron scattering techniques  the main focus will be on applications within hard condensed matter science  soft condened matter science and material science  part of the course will consist of hands on exercises performed at an international large scale x ray facility experimental exercises will be carried out at lyngby campus  in addition  the participants will spend 3 days at an international large scale facility  the students are responsible for their own travel insurance in connection with this visit
