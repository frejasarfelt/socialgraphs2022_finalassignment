this short course will present fundamentals of the bayesian approach to inverse problems  covering both modeling issues e g   prior distributions  likelihoods  hierarchical models and computational challenges e g   computing posterior expectations via markov chain monte carlo sampling or principled approximations  we will discuss methods that expose low dimensional structure in inverse problems  that attempt to mitigate the computational cost of repeated forward model evaluations  and that exhibit discretization invariant performance in large scale problems  time permitting  we will also present bayesian approaches to optimal experimental design  which attempt to answer ubiquitous questions of what or where to measure  what experimental conditions to employ  and so forth  here we will introduce a decision theoretic bayesian design formulation and link it to more classical alphabetic optimality criteria  then focus on computational issues  e g   how to estimate and maximize expected information gain in various quantities of interest full day activities over one week  lectures and computer exercises inverse problems formalize the process of learning about a system through indirect  noisy  and often incomplete observations  this course explores casting inverse problems in the bayesian statistical framework  this provides a natural framework for quantifying uncertainty in parameter values and model predictions  for fusing heterogeneous sources of information  and for optimally selecting experiments or observations the course is expected to take place in the fall semester 2022  interested parties  please contact mirza karamehmedovic  mika dtu dk  or yiqiu dong  yido dtu dk    the course instructor may complete alter the learning objectives list the course is postponed until further notice  we will update the course page as soon as the new start date is known  interested parties  please contact mirza karamehmedovic  mika dtu dk  or yiqiu dong  yido dtu dk    the course instructor may complete alter the learning objectives list
