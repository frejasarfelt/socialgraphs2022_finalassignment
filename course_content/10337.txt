microfluidics plays a crucial role in uncovering new flow phenomena  in developing theoretical models and experiments at the interface between physics  engineering  and biology  and in designing lab on a chip systems that integrate entire laboratories on single microchips    the course will help you develop your theoretical skills and physical understanding of fluid dynamics at the microscale  you will learn the basic theory of fluid dynamics  i e   the transport equations for mass  momentum  and solutes  you will get acquainted with some of the dimensionless numbers that characterize fluid flows  and you will learn how to use them for setting up and analysing models in microfluidics  progressively  you will learn methods to handle advanced microfluidic effects  including flows in complex channel geometries  finally  you will learn how to apply microfluidics to technical and biological systems the teaching will consist of a mixture of lectures and work with problems  central in the course are two project based homework problems with focus on questions of current research interest  the solutions of the two homework problems are graded and count as part of the final grade theoretical microfluidics by henrik bruus  oxford university press  oxford 2008  and lecture notesthe course introduces advanced theoretical topics in the field of microfluidics  i e   the dynamics of viscous fluid flows at the sub millimetre scale under the influence of different physical forces  you will obtain a strong theoretical basis and a good starting point for subsequent m sc  project work on fluid physics  lab on a chip systems  or biological fluid dynamics theoretical microfluidics  10337  and continuum physics  10346  are independent  the courses only overlap in the introduction to the fundamental fluid dynamics equations
