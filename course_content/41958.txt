introduction to the finite element method for structural design purposes  emphasis is placed on the systematic development of the finite element method based on the principle of virtual work  the course is structured around lectures and exercises covering both analytical approach  programming the finite element method and the use of a commercial software lectures and exercisesb√¶rende konstruktioners numeriske modellering   elementmetoden  in danish  by j h nielsen  j f olesen og j n poulsenthe finite element method  fem  is a widely used tool among civil engineers  and engineers in general  due to its generality and flexibility in a large number of engineering problems  although most practitioners use commercial programs  an understanding of the underlying theory is a necessity for performing reasonable  realistic and reliable analyzes using fem  this course focuses on the fundamentals behind the method and provides the theoretical basis for further studies  as well as the use of fem as a design tool  the course is oriented towards constructions and the structural mechanics area
