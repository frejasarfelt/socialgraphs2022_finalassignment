programming paradigms  imperative programming  object oriented programming  data structures  lists  arrays  sparse matrices  programming projects encompass    loading data    calling external programs and libraries  especially numerical     optimization and parallelization lectures  exercises  and small programming projects to enable the participants to write software that can solve numerical problems based on a mathematical model   to give the participants an introduction to imperative and object oriented programming as well as the ability to employ these paradigms using imperative and object oriented programming languages  in this course we use c c   as c based programming languages are widely used for programming mathematical software   the participants are also given an introduction to basic algorithms and data structures that are often used in mathematical software   to ensure that you  as a participant  develop practical skills  you will work with small mathematical projects in which programming is an indispensable tool  moreover  you will train software documentation in reports
