linear and nonlinear wave theories for monochromatic waves on constant depth such as higher order stokes theory  second  and third order theory for short crested waves  cnoidal theory and solitary wave theory  streamfunction methods  linear wave current interaction including doppler shift and blocking  diffraction  wave spectra and fourier techniques  spectral generation and fourier analysis of the corresponding time series  wave instabilities due to quartet   and quintet  interactions  introduction to wave modelling techniques in time and frequency domain lectures and exercises to learn the physics and mathematics involved in the description of regular and irregular water waves  this knowledge is part of detailed design and analyses of coastal and marine structures facilities it is expected that the students will bring along their own laptop and have experience in using tools like mathematica  maple and or matlab linear and nonlinear wave dynamics
