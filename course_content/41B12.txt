the course is organized in three parts  following the schedule of the classes in three modules of 9h each and focusing on  i  evacuation modeling  ii  fire modeling  and iii  integration between the two  in the first and second modules the main theoretical aspects related to computational fluid dynamic  cfd  and evacuation algorithms will be presented  respectively  the syntax of fds as cfd program and of pathfinder as evacuation program will be introduced and some simple models will be implemented  the simulations will be aimed at highlighting some critical aspects of the modeling  such as validation of the model  objectivity of the solution and sensitivity to uncertainties  at the end of the first module  the students will be asked to create an evacuation model in pathfinder for a given building used as case study and evaluate the evacuation time  at the end of the second module  the same case study will be used as basis for a cfd model to be implemented in fds and used to assess the fire development and tenability criteria  the assignment will not be graded with a 7 step scala  but on the basis of a pass not pass criterion  passing both assignments is a requirement to be admitted to the final examination  at the end of the third module  in the third module  the two home assignments will be corrected and the main critical aspects of the modeling will be discussed with more detail  few more advanced functions of fds and pathfinder will be introduced and the interaction between fire modeling and evacuation modeling will be presented  shorlty after the end of the third module  a final assignment will be given to the students in the form of an integrated design problem based on the fire and evacuation models implemented in the two previous home assignments  the final models and results should be described in a detailed report to be submitted by the exam deadline  the evaluation of the final report will determine whether the students have passed the course and their grade lectures and class excercises during the teaching modules  home study with e mail support outside the teaching periods all material is freely downloadable in the internet   fire    current release of fire dynamic symulator  fds v 6 2 0  and smokeview  smv 6 2 2 freeware  http   firemodels github io fds smv downloads html    gissi e   2009   introduction to fire simulation with fds and smokeview  https   sites google com a corbezzolo org pages home download_fse    nist special publication 1019  2015   fire dynamics simulator  version 6    user s guide  http   fire nist gov bfrlpubs fire07 pdf f07053 pdf    cfd best practice  best practice gruppen  denmark  november 2009  http   hbr dk wp content uploads 2016 10 best practice cfd november 2009 pdf   evacuation   ronchi  e   nilsson  d   2016  basic concepts and modelling methods  in  cuesta  a   abreu  o   alvear  d   eds    evacuation modeling trends  springer international publishing  cham  pp  1 23 agthe course is aimed at providing an insight into the most widely used computational tools for fire and evacuation modeling and their possible integration in relation to fire safety design  a student who has met the course objectives  is expected to be able to students are kindly asked to bring their own laptop during the classes and have fds and pathfinder installed and working before the start of the first and second module  respectively  instructions for the installations will be provided by e mails from the teachers shortly before the module start  please give notice to the teachers in advance  in case of problems with the programs
