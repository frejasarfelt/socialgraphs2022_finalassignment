the electrochemistry part of the course will focus on the physics of converting electrical energy into chemical energy storage via electrochemical systems   fundamental thermodynamics concepts  such as electrode potential  nernst equation as well as models of the electric double layer will be discussed   in addition  the kinetics of electrochemical reactions  butler volmer equation  tafel equation  etc   and the impact of mass transport will be discussed  these aspects will be covered in relation to fundamental electrochemical reactions occurring in energy conversion and storage devices   the solar cell part of the course will investigate the physics of radiation and how it affects earth in terms of both climate and as a potential energy source for photovoltaics  with this background  the course will then focus on the physics of solar cells   thus  topics such as the diode equation  electronic structure of semiconductors  doping  photogeneration of electron hole pairs  recombination sites  and junctions will all be covered lectures  assignments 	the physics of solar cells  2003  by jenny nelson   	custom electrochemistry compendiumto give the student insight into the physics behind light  its absorption by materials  and the conversion of this energy into electricity by photovoltaics and into chemical bonds by electrocatalytic processes
