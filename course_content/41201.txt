function and geometry of ships and larger floating structures  intact and damage stability of floating vessels  and hull girder loads in calm water  resistance and propulsion in calm water  power prognosis on the basis of model tests and calculation of the optimum main engine  the theory is illustrated by exercises and model tests lectures  exercises  group work  laboratory work  visit by to maritime companies to give the students an introduction to the scientific methods applied to analyse and solve problems within the maritime field in connection with ships and other floating structures  focus is given to calm water conditions exclusively  i e  no waves   and the course has two main themes   1  hydrostatics and  2  resistance and propulsion  the students will be able to calculate hydrostatics and stability  including damage stability  furthermore  the course will train the participants in analysing the propulsion of a ship and determine the necessary propulsive power with maximum efficiency no english comment
