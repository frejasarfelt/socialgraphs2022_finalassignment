the course gives an introduction to synthetic biology and the underlying concepts and notions     the course focuses on the design of molecular biological experiments and screening strategies    the participant will have to actively design device experiments on a weekly basis   after the course  the participants will be able to design all steps necessary to implement complex genetic engineering experiments  e g  cloning strategies  necessary experimental controls  expected outcomes of the different steps  and efficient screening assays for identifying cells with the desired functionalities    the central concepts and mindset within synthetic biology are introduced through textbook chapters  original literature  lectures  and case discussions  detailed design of complex molecular biological experiments is trained via weekly theoretical assignments and plenum discussions of the different team s solutions  the ethical and commercial aspects of synthetic biology are treated during the case discussions and design exercises the lecture series introduces the basic concepts of synthetic biology and molecular biological tools for genetic engineering of production organisms  in the weekly theoretical exercises  we develop competences in the design  building  testing  and learning in synbio experiments and how to evaluate designs  in parallel  the students work in smaller teams to solve an exam project  giving the opportunity to apply the course topics in relation to the exam project original literature in the form of peer review articles  selected textbook chapters and cloning procedure manuals the course introduces the basic terminology and concepts of synthetic biology and the mindset on which it depends  the course  in addition  equips the students with the necessary tools for evaluating and designing complex molecular biological experiments to allow for the implementation of bioengineering solutions to industry relevant problems
