the basis for the course is to provide the knowledge necessary to develop the methodologies for gnss data processing for enhanced positioning and navigation   the course exercises are based on the implementation of a number of routines and models often used in practice  the lectures support the exercises and provide the necessary mathematical background   the following subjects will be dealt with  computation of positions from pseudoranges and carrier phase data  modelling of clock errors and atmospheric effects  computation of dop values  transformation of positions and covariances  furthermore  examples of the use of kalman filtering for gnss positioning are discussed  including the challenges related resolution of ambiguities   exercises are carried out using matlab lectures and exercisesaccurate and reliable positioning becomes increasingly important for the navigation of vehicles  drones and autonomous systems  global satellite based positioning systems play a key role in fulfilling that need   the course aims to give a solid knowledge about global navigation satellite systems  how the systems work  and how accurate positions may be obtained  in addition  the course provides a good knowledge of the mathematical modelling principles used for both code and phase based gnss positioning  gps  galileo  or glonass  and the integration with other types of navigation sensors the course covers elements from the former 30550 satellite based positioning and more advanced topics within navigation
