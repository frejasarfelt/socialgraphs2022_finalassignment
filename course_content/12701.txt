living systems are a vast variety of natural processes involving organisms that humans further develop and enhance in order to produce feed  food  medicines  energy  different materials and improve the quality of life  specifically  living systems are open self organizing life forms that interact with their environment and are maintained by flows of information  energy and matter  the understanding of the general principles of how living systems work is crucial in order to be able to evaluate the productivity  the environmental and economic impact  and the possibilities to improve or even replace a living system with other more efficient processes  the course provides students with an essential understanding of the role of living systems in society  the most important scientific aspects related to these  and how living systems can be addressed from an engineering perspective  with focus on engineering aspects  the course addresses all key phases of a living system  cell  organ  organism  group  organization  community  society  and supranational system  the course uses peer learning through different existing living systems to provide the students with the essential understanding of the role and operation of living systems in the society e g  industrial microorganisms  fermentation systems  downstream processing  biomass  bioenergy  wastewater treatment  aquaculture production etc  finally  an overview of living systems definitions  availability  competing uses  e g  competition between resources  process efficiency  emerging technologies  etc   is provided the course combines    project based learning    peer learning    short lectures    2 excursions    a scientific report about of the state of the art of a living system  13 15 pages in groups of 3 4 people     two peer reviews of two other groups  reports  1 5 2 pages each     final presentation examination and peer discussion of the report  20 25 minutes per group  lecture notes  living systems introductory leaflet  videos  scientific articles and peer reports living systems are natural biological processes  i e  mediated by living organisms   which are used by humans for multiple purposes  to produce feed for animals  food for humans  feedstock  e g  timber  pulp  biomaterials  and energy  or to treat organic material in waste flows  supply and management of these living systems is strongly connected with significant social  economic and environmental impacts  the understanding of such systems and their components from an engineering perspective is pivotal in order to maintain  improve or even replace them based on their use and performance  with focus on major engineering aspects and using specific real life examples  the course provides an overview of living systems  characteristics and uses  the overall aim of the course is to outline the state of the art of living systems technology and current and future challenges for using them to improve human life the course cannot be taken by msc or bsc students enrolled in the environmental engineering study programmes the course cannot be taken by msc or bsc students enrolled in the environmental engineering study programmes
