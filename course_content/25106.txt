this course will introduce basic genetic theory  technology and applications to students in engineering  the course will be initiated with a review of basic genetic concepts including mendelian inheritance  linkage and recombination  this part is followed by a thorough examination of dna and rna structure  function and dynamics in relation to protein synthesis  the special cases of viral and bacterial genetics will be treated in detail  subsequently  the inheritance of complex traits coded by multiple genes will be outlined  including how genotypes can be used for the identification of genetic loci that influence trait functionality  e g  quantitative trait loci  qtl  used in trait optimization breeding strategies  in addition  the notion of and procedures for genomic analysis will be presented with specific emphasis on application in systems biology  the basic genetics part will be concluded with a focus on explaining and illustrating the concepts of evolution and population genetics and their importance for genetics in engineering  following the basic part  focus will be diverted to presenting modern dna rna technology and examples of their applications in life science and engineering  finally  the major applications of genetics in engineering will be outlined including biotechnology  biomedicine  plant and animal breeding  with gmo production  and application in food and resource management lectures  group exercisesthroughout life science genetic genomic methods are increasingly used for a wide array of applications such biotechnology  biomedicine  plant and animal breeding  with gmo production  and application in food and resource management the overarching course objective is to provide students with a basic general background in genetics and the application of genetic methods in engineering  through lectures and group exercises  the students will learn about the structure  function and dynamics of genetic information  dna and rna  and the basic genetic concepts including inheritance of simple and complex traits in single cell microorganisms and multicellular macro organisms  students will be familiarized with state of the art genetics and genomic methods and strategies for the analysis of genetic data  a diverse set of applications covering a wide range of fields will be used to illustrate the importance of genetics and genetic engineering this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  2  zero hunger    3  good health and well being    12  responsible consumption and production    14  life below water  and  15  life on land
