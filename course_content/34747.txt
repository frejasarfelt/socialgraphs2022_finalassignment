general overview of the possible applications of computers to control technology  programming controller algorithms  error sources in controller algorithms  including calculations time delay  amplitude quantization and product quantization  methods for analysing the significance of quantization errors for control quality  computerised systems for process control are reviewed  including the structure of the computer  external i o units and the structure of operating systems for process control lectures and exercisesthe use of computers in control systems gives rise to special problems of a technical nature  these are a consequence of the fact that all signals  both those that are measured and those that are calculated  can only be known with a certain degree of accuracy  it is the aim of the course to give the participants some knowledge of these problems and to teach them some rational methods for designing control algorithms  in order that the effect of limited accuracy can be reduced as much as possible  furthermore  the course looks at the problems surrounding the interaction between the internal structure of the computer and the basic software  on the background of the special control requirements that have to be met by the computer system as a whole the practical part of the course consists of a number of small excercises that introduce the computer system to the students and a large excercise that illustrates the problems arising when using computers for control and automation  e learning is used in the form of an electronic correction system and digital exam
