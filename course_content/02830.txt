students work in groups  one to four persons  independently on projects which they themselves help select and delimit within topics from the msc in human centered artificial intelligence  formerly digital media engineering     the course aims to develop the students  methods and is based on individual supervision  the students are expected to present the status of their projects at regular intervals   recent literature forms the basis of the work  and it is a stated goal to bring the students up to the research frontier in a specific area within digital media engineering students will present recent developments in their own project and results of literature surveys  we emphasize discussions between students as well as between students and supervisors to develop the student s abilities to carry out a large project in the area of digital media engineering   human centered artificial intelligence  this involves a literature study  planning  implementation  testing  experiment and the writing of a report in the form of a scientific paper    the project is considered a pre project for a master s thesis  thus it is desirable to identify a supervisor beforehand who can also supervise the subsequent master s thesis it is an advantage if students beforehand have an agreement with a master s thesis supervisor from human centered artificial intelligence  formerly digital media engineering  this is an advanced course for students at msc level
