the spectrum of water qualities in water resources and the various quality requirements according to the use of the water will be reviewed together with the amount and variation of water consumption  hygiene and water quality  the course will also deal with the chemical and biological processes in treatment of surface and ground water for and in distribution systems  including processes in domestic water installations  water works operation will be analyzed based on modelling of a number of physical chemical parameters  besides the treatment of water  the distribution system is considered  since it is the most expensive part of the water supply system  and the course involves planning  design and analysis of pumping installations  reservoirs and distribution networks  the interaction between the water and the construction material is an essential part of the processes in distribution systems  lectures are presenting the theory of the course  in parallel to the lectures the participants work in groups with structured excersises  initially by modelling of water treatment processes and finally by modelling of distribution networks  last year s lectureplan can be obtained from the course responsible  hans j√∏rgen albretchsen  hana env dtu dk  lectures  guest lectures  hand calculations and computer excersises and student project group work  if possible excursions notes and a collection of articlesto provide the students with an applied knowledge of the basic processes which are important in the production and distribution of drinking water and of water for the industry  to theoretically analyse the operation of a ground water treatment plant  and to plan  design and analyse urban water distribution systems  using both simple hand calculations and professional computer software  water supply is considered from a holistic point of view from the resources to the consumer
