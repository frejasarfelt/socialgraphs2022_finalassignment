the finite element method  fem  is of major importance for computer based simulation for engineering analysis  insight and decision support  in this course we give a concise treatment of the various aspects of the finite element method  fem  including  local and global interpolation functions based on triangular elements  boundary value problems for partial differential equations  the assembly of global algebraic system of equations  gaussian elimination for banded systems  iterative solution methods  time dependent problems  systematic development  through exercises  of computer software implementing the fem  and possible exploitation of high performance computing  the final assignment of the course will be in one of the special topics  for example an application of the finite element method for the solution of a particular problem from engineering sciences  throughout the course  emphasis is on learning methods behind fem  and linking theory and application three weeks of practical computer exercises a  p  engsig karup    the spectral hp finite element method for partial differential equations   lecture notesthe primary focus of this course is to learn and get practical experiences on how to independently develop and implement the finite element method  fem  in 1d 2d for the solution of boundary value problems  bvps  for linear partial differential equations  pdes  through computer exercises in matlab  the experiences gained in the course will be relevant for the solution of pdes rooted in engineering applications  in agreement with the teacher it is possible to define individual projects within the scope of the topic this course together with 02686 and 02687 forms a basis for understanding and applying numerical methods for the solution of differential equations  course 02689 supplements these course with details on modern scientific calculations methods
