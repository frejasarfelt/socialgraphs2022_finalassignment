most of the time  the students will work in the laboratory in project teams  introductory lectures are given on    smart grids and related ict technology   specific smart grid applications  projects     arduino mkr1000 1010 microcontroller system and its peripherals  a d and d a converters  timer  i o  interrupte  and lcd display  etc     the integrated development environment arduino embedded workbench   communication systems in intelligent energy systems   user centered interface designintroductory lectures and project teamworkthe term smart grid is used to describe the vision of a future energy system that incorporates a large share of renewable energy sources into a highly automated  flexible and reliable system   examples of smart grid technologies are household appliances that react intelligently to varying system conditions  automatic mechanisms for coordination of resources  and advanced information exchange systems   the objective of this course is to gain hands on experience with technologies used in such systems  by designing  implementing and testing a smart grid application on a microcontroller system   the intelligent energy systems are used as a case for the application  but no previous experience with energy systems is required from the students this course gives synthesis competence in the msc  ee  msc  wind and sustainable energy program
