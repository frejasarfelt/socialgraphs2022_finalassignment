the lectures will cover the life science  and medical background for applications of light for treatment and diagnosis  particularly in human tissue  an exemplary organ is the eye  here the wavelength dependent optical properties like absorption  light scattering and fluorescence of the eye facilitate optical diagnostics and treatment of critical organs like the cornea  lens and retina by optical methods  furthermore  the optical properties of lasers  different laser systems and their potential for applications in biomedicine and life science will be elaborated  an integral part of the course is that students present scientific papers in journal clubs  throughout the course  practical examples and demonstrations will be used whenever possible lectures and journal clubsthe interest in applications of coherent light and optical sensing in life science and biomedicine has been increasing the past years  this is partly due to the development of new laser systems  partly the development in optical systems and finally advances in precise and non invasive diagnostics and analysis methods  the objectives of the course are divided into three areas   1  to identify key parameters for light sources for medical diagnostics and treatment   2  to understand and analyse processes of light tissue interactions  and 3  to select the appropriate combination of light sources and light tissue interactions in the      design of biomedical imaging and life science applications and analyse its performance lecturers from dtu fotonik  and a number of invited external lectures  if possible  a study trip to the department of ophthalmology at glostrup  hospital will be arranged
