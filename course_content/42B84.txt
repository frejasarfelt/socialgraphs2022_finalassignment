 artificial intelligence  ai  is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines  in particular intelligent computer programs   this definition of artificial intelligence by john mccarthy  the father of the area  is still valid today  60 years after it was formulated  nevertheless  the area is much harder to define and delimit than most other areas of science and engineering  since intelligence is many different things  e g  social  linguistic or emotional intelligence  and at very different levels  correspondingly  ai is many very distinct techniques to mimic different aspects of human intelligence  and at very different levels  this makes it difficult to navigate in the area of ai and understand exactly what it can and cannot do  one of the goals of the course is to clarify the different paradigms  methods and subareas of ai  to provide a clear picture of what ai is  to make it easier to understand the current developments in the area  and to understand the possibilities and limitations of ai methods in general   ai is about mimicking the most essential abilities of humans  our cognitive abilities  perceiving  reasoning  planning  communicating  learning  etc  hence ai has the potential of transforming our lives  society and businesses in a much more fundamental way than any other technology  underlying and unifying the different methods in ai is usually the goal of making machines do what hitherto only humans have been able to  e g  play chess  recognise faces  engage in a dialogue  drive a car or do medical diagnosis  the main source of inspiration for building ai systems that can solve these problems is human problem solving  in some cases  ai systems are based on a very direct attempt to simulate the fundamental neurological processes of the human brain  in other cases  they are based on more abstract models of human reasoning and problem solving  however  it is important to understand that there still is   and probably always will be   fundamental differences between human and machine intelligence  these fundamental differences are essential to grasp in order to understand where ai techniques can succesfully be employed  what kind of human tasks can be replaced or enhanced by the use of ai  and how ai is going to affect the future job marked  these aspects will all be thoroughly covered in the course  the course will address both the benefits and the potential negative consequences  including discussions of the legal  ethical and philosophical aspects of ai the program is based on action learning where theories  methods  concepts and tools are employed on real business challenges and issues from the participants companies  lectures are paralleled by casework  group work and assignments the course is dedicated to technical aspects of artificial intelligence  introducing the main paradigms  methods and application areas as well as discussions of legal  societal  economical  ethical  and philospical aspects participation in the program requires separate admission to the mmt program  the price of the mmt program is dkk 380 000  please contact dtu executive mba
