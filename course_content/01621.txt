global bifurcations  melnikov theory and horseshoes  compactification  singular perturbation theory  blowupthis course covers theory and techniques used for studying and solving global problems occurring in nonlinear ordinary differential equations  whereas focus in introductory level dynamical systems courses  see e g  01617  is on local phenomena near equilibria  attention in this course will be on global phenomena  such as limit cycles and heteroclinics homoclinic connections   topics will include global bifurcations  melnikov theory and horseshoe maps  poincaré maps  singular perturbation theory  poincaré compactification  and blowup techniques  the theory will be applied to equations arising in the applied sciences the course can be followed in parallel with 01622
