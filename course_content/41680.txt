the course treats materials and their modelling with main emphasis on metals  polymers  ceramics  and composites are presented complementary  focus is on the relation between processing of materials  their resulting internal structure and their properties and performance  the course contains     atomic bonds  crystal structures  lattice defects  amorphous and semi crystalline materials    phase diagrams  interpretation of these and calculation of mass fractions  phase equilibria   changes in the microstructure of materials due to mechanical and thermal load    mechanical properties  testing and methods of changing the strength of metals  polymers and ceramics    thermal and electrical properties of materials and their physical origin   introduction to material database software    modelling of materials and their structures    statistical analysis of materials data and correlations between structure and propertiesthe teaching is based on active participation of students in group work  there will be introductory and summing up lectures w d  callister  d g  rethwisch  materials science and engineering  global edition  wileythe course provides a broad and general knowledge of materials and their model description  the course aims to give an understanding of how different materials are and what these differences mean for their properties  modelling and application  the course highlights the relationship between the microstructure of the materials and their properties as well as their description in terms of models  insight will be gained into methods to change materials properties and to select the most suitable materials using a material data base the course is a technology core course for b sc  in general engineering and obligatory for specialization advanced materials
