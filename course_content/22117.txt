protein structure from primary to quaternary  experimental determination of protein structures  structural genomics  prediction of secondary structure  accessibility etc  fold recognition  homology and de novo modelling  structure validation  protein structure analysis  protein engineering  molecular dynamics simulationslectures  computer exercises  hand in exercises and group workthe aim of the course is to enable students to analyse protein structure and function for the purpose of rational drug design  optimization of biocatalysts and understanding of disease related mutations  this includes practical computer exercises dealing with construction and validation of models of proteins for which no experimental structure is available  as this allows prediction of biological properties of novel proteins the project work at the end of the course is performed in small  self elected groups and completed with scientific articles     the hand in exercises  2  deal mainly with protein structure visualisation using the program pymol  the models will be predicted with hhpred and alphafold2  the mutational scans will be performed using foldx
