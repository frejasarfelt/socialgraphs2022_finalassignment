this course will cover   1  several distributed coordination paradigms   2  software run time frameworks supporting those paradigms   3  a set of simple distributed algorithms and applications lectures  project work and presentations from the participants distributed applications exploit all kinds of networked resources  from local networks  to clouds  to the entire internet  in order to offer ubiquitous and performant services  programming a distributed application may be tedious and challenging  due to the need to consider different kinds of devices and communication channels   high level coordination and programming paradigms such as tuple spaces  protocols  actors  workflows  streams and so on  simplify this task  by offering suitable abstractions that hide low level concurrency and communication issues thus allowing one to focus on the core logic of applications  coordination  functionality  security  etc    this course will introduce students to basic concepts of coordination and will provide students first experience with the development of distributed applications based on those concepts  the course will include lectures introducing basic notions and background  project work  and presentations by the students  students will work in groups on self defined projects  where they develop distributed applications
