the course is taught in danish   three dimensional stresses and strains  principal stresses   strains and the associated principal coordinate systems  hooke s generalized law  plane stress and strain  deformation of thick walled pipes and circular discs  plastic deformation mechanisms and yield hypotheses  dimensioning against fatigue fractures  as part of the course  the student is introduced to multidimensional elastic stress and deformation analysis  dimensioning is introduced against permanent deformation  plasticity  as well as fatigue fractures the course is taught in danish to enable the student to analyze and calculate how a given structure ie  machine components  pressure vessels  shrinkage joints  structures  frames  etc  deform and when plastic deformation or fatigue occurs  the content of the course constitute a necessary prerequisite for the use and understanding of the finite element method  fem   and not least  the ability to provide qualified assessment and interpretation of results obtained through fem calculations
