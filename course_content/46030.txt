  ac power and complex representation   ac generators and load types   transport of electrical power from producer to consumer   power and energy flow in distribution systems   diodes and transistors in ac systems   ac dc conversion   electric vehicles and battery couplinglectures and mandatory assignments and exercisesthe main goal of the course is to enable the students to understand electrical energy systems and to perform calculations based on a range from very fundamental laws to more complex relations  where new energy producing or consuming units like wind power and electric vehicles have to be integrated into a grid structure  the students achieve competences  which are necessary for further work with electrical energy systems  independent of the later specialisation in either digital solutions  energy techologies or energy innovation  many of the theoretic elements in the course will be related to the challenges you see  when integrating electric vehicles into the grid  though limited to a very basic level   theory is transferred to practical applications in a newly established learning environment  where the most important relations can be tested  while the students learn to work in laboratories and use relevant measuring and test equipment 31735 electrical energy systems
