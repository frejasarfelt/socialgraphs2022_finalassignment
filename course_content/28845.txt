the operation of chemical and catalytic reactors are investigated experimentally  the dynamic startup of an adiabatic tank reactor  residence time distribution  multiple steady states  operation of a catalytic fixed bed reactor  the experimental results are analysed on the basis of theory taught in the introductory course in chemical reaction engineering  models for the dynamic approach to steady state are developed and implemented in numerical solvers  application of programs like excel and maple is an integrated part of the course  see qualified prerequisites and remarks  laboratory experiments  computer simulations calculations and writing of reportsto illustrate the theory taught in a basic chemical reaction engineering course  such as 28140 introduction to chemical reaction engineering or 28342 chemical reaction engineering  by experimental exercises with accompanying calculations and simulations the teaching in january 2021 will be held on campus students in the msc chemical and biochemical engineering program have preferential access   students who cannot use spreadsheets and simulation software as specified in the qualified prerequisites will be dropped from the course by the instructor
