the course starts with examples from regulatory network motifs and how small circuits of transcription factors function to give cells more precise gene regulation  modelling and simulation of these circuits is performed to illustrate the dynamics of these expression systems under changing environments  several functional properties of regulatory network motifs are covered  including signal processing  switching  memory  and oscillations  special attention is given to the temporal dynamics of these systems and how they can be modelled and analyzed   biological systems that provide cells with robustness to noise are covered in the second half of the course  robustness is illustrated in networks of biochemical reactions that have evolved to increase their accuracy despite variability in enzyme or substrate levels  examples include kinetic proofreading in protein synthesis  t cell recognition  and cell signaling with two component systems    the course finishes with the theme of optimality and how biological systems can evolve to optimize biological features  how microorganisms evolve to express optimal levels of protein is modelled systematically through cost benefit analysis  the mathematical models used to define fitness functions are analyzed to illustrate the evolution of gene regulation over hundreds of generations in bacteria  and how these models can be used to predict optimal levels of protein expression lectures and exercises biology can appear astonishingly complex  despite this  there are discernable patterns that appear to be conserved throughout the living systems we study  these patterns are often observed in the molecular interactions inside cells or between cells that define biological networks  these biological networks give cells and organism functional capabilities related to signaling  regulation and other processes central to survival  the objective of this course is to see how complex biological processes can be simplified to biological network models that can be used to understand these processes and why they may represent general principles in a variety of biological contexts
