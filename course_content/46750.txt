this course focuses on how to take optimal decisions that deal with both the economic and the technical operation of power systems  we learn how to analyze and formulate optimization problems  for different objectives and accuracy  from an economic point of view  we cover electricity market operation  optimal bidding strategies for power producers  and optimal investment strategies for transmission owners  from a technical point of view  we cover the minimization of losses  minimization of reactive power needs  and optimal location of grid reinforcements  the course also focuses on the basic principles of how an optimization solver works  their strengths and weaknesses  this will lead to a better understanding of how to formulate a general optimization problem  which can be applied to any decision making process in the real world lectures  exercises  computer exercises  project workoptimization is a powerful tool that has several applications in power system operation  optimization tools are used by electricity market operators  power system operators  and other players  such tools define the market clearing  identify optimal bidding strategies for generators  determine optimal control actions for operators to e g  minimize losses  and help devise optimal investment strategies for the future electricity grid  this course introduces the students to general optimization algorithms  explains their principles  and shows them how to formulate and solve the relevant problems in power systems  the knowledge acquired through this course could be applied to any decision making process  e g  devise the optimal stock portfolio for a bank  find the fastest transportation route  and others this course will  not  be offered in fall 2022
