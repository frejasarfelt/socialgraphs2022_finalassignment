application of microbiology and biotechnology in food processes and production of food and feed ingredients  which microbes are used in food production  how do they behave and how is the taste  flavor  rheology and shelf life affected  how do the bacteria we eat affect our health and can we change the bacterial content in the intestine to improve health   how can new microorganisms be developed for production of food ingredients using either traditional breeding and screening techniques or using gene technologies and synthetic biology  what does food production in the future look like  can we make  meat  using plant materials or using microbially produced ingredients  can waste and side streams from the food industry be eliminated and instead turned into valuable resources for production of food and food ingredients  how does a more efficient utilization of our resources affect the global food supply and the environment lectures and group presentations of articlesto equip students with knowledge about the latest biotechnological advances in food as well as the methods and production processes used during production of food or feed ingredients  probiotics  biochemicals  plant based and alternative protein sources  etc  though the course the students will gain sufficient knowledge and understanding which will enable them to further their research and development skills within all areas which include elements of microbial production  lectures from representatives from companies will also strengthen the students  appreciation of the journey from theory to application and production in real life cases a background in molecular biology  gene cloning  pcr  western blot  etc is essential to understand and follow the course
