the course aims to introduce the students to state of the art methods within computational immunology   there is a strong focus on introducing the methods in context with immunology as domain specific knowledge area  furthermore  introduction to the theory of the methods will be followed by practical exercises  enabling the student to independently perform analyses  the course covers immunological bioinformatics and computational vaccinology with an outlook to infectious diseases  cancer immunotherapy  and autoimmunity   the course is taught in two parts  part 1 covers lectures and group based exercises and part 2 will cover group based project work aiming at creating a full project workflow lectures and exercises  student are required to bring a laptop  capable of connecting to the internet all relevant literature will be available via dtu learnthe student will be able to outline the theoretical background  apply and analyse the output of computational methods related to the prediction of immune responses  moreover  they will be able to    describe the involvement of the t cell receptor  tcr   b cell receptor  bcr  and major histocompatibility complex  mhc  in inducing an immune response    summarise the structural and genetic characteristics of the tcr  bcr and mhc and their corresponding epitopes    apply computational methods for modelling tcr  bcr and mhc and their epitope interactions  apply computational methods for rational design of vaccines   apply  discuss  and combine computational methods of the above in disease context  i e  vaccinology of infectious diseases and cancer   general engineering competencies are included in context with concrete application in a group based project work  where the students are responsible for planning  designing  implementing and communicating a project the course has changed schedule to the autumn semester  but is not offered in autumn 2022  students who expected to take the course in 2022 2023  have the option of taking the course as a self study  special course  in spring 2023  please contact course responsible
