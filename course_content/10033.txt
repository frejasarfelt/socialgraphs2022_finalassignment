newton s laws  and the angular momentum relation   applied partly to particles and partly to rigid bodies  the law of conservation of energy  conservative and non conservative forces  collisions  introduction to ficticious forces  oscillations  elements of lagrangian formalism  practical considerations concerning computer simulation  applications of error analysis  applications of dimensional analysis and non dimensionalisation lectures  group exercises  computer simulations  and experiments our aim is to make the student familiar with the fundamental concepts of mechanics  and enable the student to apply analytical methods  when solving simple mechanical and technical problems   to achieve our objective of giving our students a more intuitive understanding of the laws of motion  we use a combination of analytical methods and computer simulations  the use of computer simulations will enable us to perform more complex as well as technically relevant tasks the course is only available to physics and nanotechnology and earth and space physics engineering bachelor students
