the course will explain and interpret how oceanographic processes affect production and distribution of fish populations  students will learn how various physical processes and mechanisms  e g   storms  extreme temperature conditions  affect fish eggs  larvae  juveniles and adults  and how those processes can make populations more or less vulnerable to human activities such as fishing and eutrophication   the course lectures will initially cover key concepts and paradigms in fisheries oceanography and then be followed by lectures on larval feeding ecology and predation processes  e g   fish  jellyfish  before progressing to the oceanographic impacts on higher levels of biological organisation  i e   biodiversity  biogeography  foodweb interactions involving fish   the course will span concepts from individual to population and community scales  and from small to large temporal   spatial scales   students will learn how knowledge of specific processes can be applied to advise on how to conserve and manage fish populations and marine ecosystems   the course will include some modelling and statistical exercises  and case study analyses of oceanographic and fishing impacts on 2 3 selected fish populations and communities teaching will be done by the following methods   	lectures and guest lectures   	student oral presentations   	individual and group practical exercises the course will provide an in depth understanding of how oceanographic and marine ecosystem processes affect and interact with ecology of fish  e g   productivity  survival  geographical distributions  and fisheries  the course will emphasize interactions between natural and human induced climate variability change  exploitation  and eutrophication  and will build on principles established in earlier courses in the curriculum  course core elements  1  dynamics of populations and ecosystems at multiple time space scales  cm   1000s km and s   millennia  2  multiple drivers  or perturbations  of change   fishing  climate change and variability  eutrophication  habtitat alteration 3  responses of fish populations to perturbations   productivity  distributions  growth  survival  yields 4  processes affecting survival and growth of early life history stages  larval ecology  feeding success  survival probability 5  scientific method to problem solving and hypothesis testing  6  interpretation of observational fisheries oceanographic datathis course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  12  responsible consumption and production    13  climate action  and  14  life below water
