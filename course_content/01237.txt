time dependent deformation matrices and their svd decompositions  rotation matrices  kinematics in plane and space  the frenet serret basis for curves and the ensuing curvature and torsion  parametrization of curves and surfaces  in particular via sweeping and rolling  analysis of surfaces via the first and second fundamental form  the weingarten matrix and the principal curvatures and principal directions   ruled surfaces and developable surfaces  the gauss curvature and mean curvature of surfaces  special curves on surfaces  geodesics  curvature lines  asymptotic curves  applications of these methods and concepts in architectural engineering and sculptural design  applications of computer experiments  illustrations  and calculations to support all the learning elements of the course lectures and exercises including computer experiments with maple and m√∂bius  project exercises for two weeks at the end of the semester notes to provide the students with solid framework for understanding and applying a number of geometric techniques as they are used in engineering and architectural design contexts  to apply families of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices to construct and analyze geometric shapes in plane and space  to introduce effective methods for parametric design and analysis of curves and surfaces  to apply computer experiments as an integrated part of the course for illustrations  learning  and calculations  the course gives a solid introduction to the elementary basic concepts needed for the more advanced course 01238 differential geometry
