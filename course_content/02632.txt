programming language  matlab or python  using the desktop environment and language documentation  working with numbers  strings  logical values  vectors and matrices  using arithmetic and logical operators  branching statements  looping and vectorization  organizing code using scripts and functions  error checking user input and creating interactive programs  writing comments and technical documentation  reading and writing data files  graphical visualization of data exercises and project work in databar the use of computers for technical mathematical computations and simulations is central for many areas at dtu  and it is therefore necessary to have a working knowledge of computer programming  in the course students will learn about basic concepts and techniques in programming  as well as how to write programs with a focus on computations with technical engineering applications  the participants will be able to design and develop well structured smaller programs  test the design and program  read various data formats  and visualize the results graphically  one of the programming languages matlab or python course 02631 02633 is recommended when programming is to be used for model calculations and scientific computation  and 02601 02603 and 01257 are following courses focusing on modelling and computation  while 02637 focuses on programming  if the student wishes to continue within computer science and advanced programming courses  we recommend instead the java course 02101 02102   ask at your department what is recommended and used  the introductory programming courses do not exclude each other
