the course covers theory of transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy  including sources  optics and image formation  the physics behind image and contrast formation are covered for both microscopies as well  the theory behind energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy is introduced  the lab exercises make use of the aspects introduced in the lectures and covers practical data analysis using commercial software packages  the lab exercises also cover the practical use and operation of the instruments as well as best practice approaches for specific characterization tasks  in addition  the labs will provide the students with user access to the tools in the labs hands on instructions and tutorials at the microscopes at dtu nanolab in building 314  lectures  exercises  data analysis  project work and journal club joseph goldstein et al  scanning electron microscopy and x ray microanalysis fourth edition  springer  2018   isbn 978 1 4939 6674 5 david b  williams and c  barry carter  transmission electron microscopy   a textbook in materials science  springer  2009   isbn 978 0 387 76502 0the purpose of this course is to provide the students with knowledge and practical skills within the key techniques of electron microscopy and associated spectroscopies  1  transmission electron microscopy  2  scanning electron microscopy  3  x ray energy dispersive spectroscopy and 4  electron energy loss spectroscopy  furthermore  to determine micro and nano structure  as well as material composition and chemistry based on data collected using these tools  students should be able to identify potential sources of error and pitfalls including electron beam artefacts in the acquired data  finally  students should be able to form hypothesis using the acquired data and discuss the data in relation to complementary data   students participating in this course should have a fundamental understanding of the structure of matter including basic knowledge of solid state physics  this could be basic knowledge from solid state physics  they should have basic knowledge about the laws of physics and how to apply them  after having completed the course  students should be capable of operating the tools independently previously  this course had the number 10867   the course is intended as introductory course for phd students who plan to use electron microscopy or related spectroscopies in their phd studies   we recommend supervisors and students to contact a course responsible as early as possible to discuss the relevance of the course for the phd student
