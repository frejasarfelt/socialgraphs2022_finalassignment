the course consists of three parts  in the first part the stochastic system is assumed to be known and the basic stochastic control theory is given  in order to considering control of an unknown system the second part of the course deals with modelling stochastic systems  i e  system identification and parameter estimation   in the third and final part of the course the methods described in the previous parts are combined in adaptive control  i e  control of unknown dynamic systems  the methods are mainly given for discrete time  state space   and transfer function models lectures and tutorials to give the students a knowledge of methods for    1  describing and controlling dynamic systems  which are influenced by stochastic disturbances    2  identification of stochastic systems  i e  estimation of unknown parameters  and  finally  3  adaptive control of stochastic systems in this course control theory is combined with optimization and statistics   the course is related to advanced courses in control and to static and dynamic optimization  02711
