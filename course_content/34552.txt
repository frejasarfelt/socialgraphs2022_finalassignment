the course will explain the principle components within photovoltaic systems  how they work and how they interact within the system  the course will start by discussing the nature of the solar resource and then move into the fundamentals of solar cell physics where it will be explained how solar cells convert light to electricity and how they are manufactured  subsequently  the course will cover topics in pv modules  including their design  fabrication  characterization and durability  next  the course covers how to interface pv modules with power electronics where the working principles of pv electronics will be explained  further into the course the most common power loss and degradation mechanisms found in fielded systems will be presented  these topics are finally combined and applied where the student will conduct group exercises covering pv system dimensioning  energy yield predictions  and economic calculations lectures  theoretical exercises  and group project work the course gives the student a solid foundation in the engineering concepts used in the design and construction of photovoltaic systems  the student will demonstrate knowledge of the working principles of the individual system components including  cells  modules  electronics and balance of system  bos  components  the student will become knowledgeable in the entire value chain of photovoltaic  pv  systems from how solar cells and modules are fabricated to how photovoltaic systems are designed  the student will be able to explain the operation  performance  reliability  and economics from small scale residential systems to large scale pv power plants  upon completion of this course the student will be able to design and model the energy and financial performance of a photovoltaic power system teachers  sune thorsteinsson  sergiu spataru
