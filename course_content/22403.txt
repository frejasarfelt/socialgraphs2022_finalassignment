micro and nano sensors are emerging as promising techniques in for example diagnostics  drug delivery and environmental control  they have the potential to be very small  simple and cheap as they do not require time consuming labelling by i e fluorescent markers and bulky read out units  however  it is sometimes complicated to understand the possibilities and limitations of the individual technologies both in terms of realization and applications   we will combine lectures on sensing principles and surface chemistry with hands on laboratory work  you will have the possibility to  1  fabricate sensors  2  functionalize sensors  3  apply the sensors for biological or environmental sensing or apply the sensors in the areas of biological research and or drug delivery  there will also be a focus on the sensors in the area of drug delivery   a field with a large potential  this course will run in parallel with the dtu health tech summer school  drug delivery   using nano and microtechnologies  with some joined lectures and sessions  moreover  there will also be focus on career development in academia and industry and inputs from start up companies    the experimental work will be performed in teams and the developed technologies will be presented and discussed to discover pros and cons on the various technologies and methods  by the end of the school you will in collaboration with the lecturers and your fellow students have generated an overview of the strength and weaknesses of the different sensors  to pass the course  you must take active part in the group work and in the scientific discussions  come and join us in this challenging endeavour   the course is for phd students onlylectures  exercises  discussions in groups and in plenum and project work  you need to take active part in lectures  project work and exercises  you are required to present your own field of research as well the results from the project work research and review papers  see also the course webpage https   www healthtech dtu dk uddannelse drug sensor summerschoolsthe aim of this phd summer school is to give you an overview of the state of the art micro and nano sensors such as electrochemical sensors  raman and sers based sensors and to give you hands on experience in sensor fabrication and sensor applications
