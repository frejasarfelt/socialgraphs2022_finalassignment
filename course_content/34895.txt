the course deals with current research in theoretical and experimental acoustics  such as advanced measurement techniques  e g   beamforming and acoustic holography  analysis and reduction of structural vibrations  determination of room acoustic parameters and their effect on perception  the vibroacoustic properties of buildings  and the behaviour of the loudspeaker for small signals as well as in the non linear domain   each student should give two oral presentations over the course of the year  one of the presentations should summarize and discuss the purpose  the methods and the key results in selected recent scientific publications from high profile journals and should emphasize the impact of the findings for future research directions  the other presentation should focus on the specific research topic of the individual phd student and closely related areas  in addition  a written summary of the presentations and relevant discussion is required  each student should to attend at least 70  of the presentations throughout the course  the presentations and the written material will be collected during the course and serve as the basis for evaluation to develop the student s self learning ability and to increase the knowledge of recent literature within the student s own research area and related topics  to improve the student s scientific communication skills and promote scientific discussions of current topics in acoustics
