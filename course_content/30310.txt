the course consists of two parts  the lecture hours where the theory  processes and methods for systems engineering are taught  and the group work part where the students will solve assignments with a focus on applying the methods of system engineering to a given spacecraft project  to bring a project successfully towards a critical design review lectures and group work during the 13 week spring period main litterature    hirshorn  nasa systems engineering handbook  rev 2  2007 supplemental litterature    fortescue  swinerd  and stark  spacecraft systems engineering  4th edition  wiley  2011   pisacane  fundamentals of space systems  2  edition  oxford  2005 the course aims at teaching a fundamental and holistic approach to the field of systems engineering that applies specifically to complex high tech industries  like the aerospace industry  the field of systems engineering is highly multidisciplinary  requiring a broad knowledge base and experience to draw from  for complex and wide ranging projects  like a spacecraft mission  to succeed  a systems engineer s key role and methods are essential to make ends meet and fulfil a mission s requirements the course is reserved for students in the master s programme in earth and space physics and engineering
