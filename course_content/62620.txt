  the environmental problems that are associated with producing a material    overview of where the elements or materials come from and the consequences of extracting them    methods to quantify environmental problems  thereby assessing the environmental problems for each material and the contribution of each stage of the manufacturing process  es     calculation of the energy associated with the manufacture of materials  as well as co2 equivalents in the manufacture of materials    definition of the term  embodied energy     a clear definition of the concept of critical materials    methods for assessing how large reserves are in the world of the various materials   elements and to calculate their index of exhaustion    the reason why do we use the materials we do  and which properties of the critical materials makes them so attractive that we choose to use them    models for the consumption of materials in the future    the computer program granta edu pack as a tool for assessing the environmental consequences of extraction and use of materials    methods for assessing the environmental impact of a product throughout the life of the product  and thereby assessing the environmental impact both from the materials in the product and from the use of the product    the concepts recycling  down cycling  lca and eco comparison models    methods   principles for manufacturing apparatus using materials with low environmental impact while the product properties are acceptable    overview of possible replacement materials   alternative materials and their consequences    calculation   assessment of which product changes the use of alternative materials leads to  and calculation of how much it helps on the environmental impact to use these materials    in addition to the above topics  the course contains many examples of the above  so that the student have a  hands on  the mentioned topics    the course also includes a project work  where the student redesigns one or more products  so that they give a lesser environmental impact while their functions are maintained lecture and exercises  possibly project work is includedmichael f  ashby   materials and the environment  3rd edition   elsevierthe overall course objective is to make the topic environmental impact by implication of materials manageable  so that environmental impact can be included as a measurable parameter beside the other properties of a material and thereby can be included as a parameter when designing a product similar to the other specifications   the purpose is also to make the students aware that a product must meet both environmental requirements and application requirements  and to provide them with a tool for this  this also includes the possibilities of increased material recycling in product manufacture   the course will help the student to meet the un world goal no  12
