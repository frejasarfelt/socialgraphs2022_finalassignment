the fundamental materials science aspects of biomaterials  such as manufacture  structure  and properties  will be reviewed in close connection with practical operation  performance and failure mechanisms of biomedical devices and implants  man made materials  metals  ceramics  polymers  as wells as biological materials will be considered   we will survey the many adverse effects that the introduction of a foreign material can induce in the body  including toxicity  immunological responses  and infection  this knowledge will be an outset for discussing how to maximize functionality and minimize adverse effects by proper choice of the biomaterial itself  design of the device shape and structure  and modification of its surface properties  problem based assignments will be based on examples of real world devices in use or under development  their current application and potential need for improvement will be discussed by guest lecturers from industry   biomaterial stability and degradation mechanisms will be described  examples will show how understanding and control of the degradation processes are equally important whether biomaterial degradation is needed as in a cell scaffold for tissue engineering or unwanted as in a permanent implant    the clinical use of biomaterials requires prior evaluation and approval by medical authorities  we will consider selected requirements in more detail and discuss how they may delay or even prevent the introduction of new biomaterials for actual clinical application 4 hours per week  problem based activities  lectures  classroom discussions  exercises wagner et al   eds    biomaterials science  an introduction to materials in medicine  4th edition  academic press 2020 the course will give you a broad introduction to the physical  chemical  and mechanical requirements of a biomaterial to be used inside or outside the human body  and provide you with a knowledge foundation for choosing and optimizing biomaterials for selected biomedical applications  examples will include hard biomaterials  e g  for bone replacement   soft biomaterials  e g  for heart valve replacement   and ultra soft biomaterials  e g  for cell scaffolds in tissue engineering   with intended applications in the body or for laboratory use
