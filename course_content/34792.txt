advanced topics in robots and autonomous systems  including  filters for localization  navigation algorithms  exception handling  planning and user interfaces participants work indevidually with design and implementation of robot and autonomous systems  that is chosen by the participant  and approved by the lecturers the course runs as a combination of a study group for the theory part followed by a design and implementation part where participants appy theory and methods on an object related to their own research selected journal papers to make participants able to apply robotics and autonomous systems at an international level  the course aims at giving participants ability to demonstrate the theory and methods on a case relevant for the participant s own research
