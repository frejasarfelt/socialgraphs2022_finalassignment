the course provides a comprehensive overview in the field of modeling and simulation techniques of thermal energy systems  practical experience in simulation of energy systems is gained by working on several projects throughout the course  the projects cover work with thermodynamic models to define the design of systems and components and analyse their operation    the relevant stages of a modeling project are discussed and completed  starting with the definition of the task  knowledge gathering and qualitative description of the task  this is continued by the definition of the mathematical equations and the choices of the method and the tool for numerically solving these equations  finally  a graphical user interface  gui  is developed is order to reflect the simulation purposes of the numerical model    the modeling and simulation program engineering equation solver  ees  is used in the course   other simulation tools  dna and open modelica  will be introduced as needed   the projects cover work with models on cycle  system and component level  and with models for design and off design operation of plants alternating use of lectures  studies  exercises  and problem sessions and presentation of project work the aim with the course is to acquire knowledge and experience in numerical modelling for  simulating thermal energy systems  the focus is on the development of physically  mathematically  and numerically consistent models in the field of refrigeration  heat pumps and power generation plants  the students will work on individual chosen projects related to the topic  for example shio machinery  internal combustion engines  large scale heat pumps for district heating and geothermal or solar driven power cycles   students will develop awareness of the power and utility of numerical simulations in engineering design  at both the system and the component detail level    after completion of the course  the students will be prepared for using simulation tools  analysing the simulation results critically and writing documentation for model based projects   the course covers application of thermodynamic principles  methodological model development and numerical analysis for the description  simulation  and optimization of energy systems   after completion of the course the student will be prepared for using simulation tools which are relevant for further studies and projects in thermal energy experience is also acquired in the use of it techniques
