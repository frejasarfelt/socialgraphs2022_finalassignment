the course is formulated into three projects and a group report is expected for each project  project 1  preparation and characterization of platinum catalyst  ion conducting membrane  electrodes and a polymer fuel cell   project 2  preparation of methanol reforming catalyst  construction of laboratory reactor  reformer  with measurement and control of temperature  test of methanol reformer  integration and operation of fuel cells and reformer   project 3  preparation and characterization of catalyst and electrodes and test of water electrolyzer lab work  group work  introductory lectures safety in the lab is part of the course the course will be evaluated during the course periodin the course we only use teaching material   textbooks  assignments  articles  etc   that is available free of charge from the course homepage on dtu learn to give practical experience in hydrogen energy systems  key materials and components from the whole hydrogen chain are addressed by fabrication of catalysts  membranes and electrodes  construction of testing devices includes methanol reformer  water electrolysis cell and polymer membrane fuel cells  in this way  the course is meant to address a broader range of knowledge from fundamental materials to hydrogen energy technologies  the theoretical grounds for the techniques are established through a series of short introductory lectures hands on  can you produce hydrogen and use it in your own fuel cell the course is important for special courses and experimental research and development work in the msc thesis within energy conversion technologies  safety in the lab is of paramount importance and labcoat and safety glasses are mandatory during all exercises  the students are encouraged to bring labcoat and safety glasses  but it is also possible for some to borrow
