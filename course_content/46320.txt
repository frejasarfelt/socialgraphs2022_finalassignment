this course uses the skills learned in 46300 and 46310 as a springboard to deepen students  practical knowledge of the interaction between aerodynamics  loads and controls during turbine design  during the course of the semester  the students will work in groups to redesign the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine for a different wind class  the following topics will be covered  methods for redesigning a wind turbine rotor  wind turbine control basics and controller tuning  wind turbine dynamics and aeroelastic mode shapes  lifetime load calculations  fatigue   extreme   wind turbine certification standards and more   the theories  sub models  and methods introduced in this course are applicable for general modelling and analysis of wind turbines  however  the students will work with the hawc software  hawc2s hawc2 hawcstab2  for aeroelastic simulations  hawc2   aeroelastic modal analysis of wind turbines  hawcstab2  and controller tuning  hawc2s  lectures and group work on reports  3 4 students per group to give the students advanced competencies in modelling and analysing the structural dynamics  aerodynamics  aeroelastic characteristics and control of wind turbines using analytical and numerical methods  thereby creating a basis for evaluating the loads performance trade off during wind turbine design
