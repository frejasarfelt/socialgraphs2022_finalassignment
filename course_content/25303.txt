the course is an introduction to mathematical modelling of population dynamics of living organisms  from bacteria to whales  focus is on conceptual models based on differential and difference equations that illustrate basic concepts in population modelling  an important goal is to develop the ability to connect a biological context to an abstract mathematical model  i e   to develop an understanding of the biological assumptions underlying the model and the ecological consequences of its results  the main topics are single species population models  logistic growth   multi species models  competition and predator prey relations   functional responses  exploitation of living systems  seasonal succession  epidemiological models  and spatial population dynamics  further basic concepts from evolutionary dynamics are introduced  some emphasis is on the development and evaluation of the presentation skills of the students  in the last part of the course  the students develop their own projects  which  are evaluated in a poster session short lectures and longer numerical  computer  exercises  the results of the exercises are presented by the students and discussed in plenum nicholas j  gotelli  a primer of ecology  sinauer associatethe course is an introduction to mathematical modelling of biological systems  it will enable the student to evaluate  develop and apply simple dynamical population models
