the course will cover the most commonly used algorithms in bioinformatics  emphasis will be on the precise mathematical implementation of the algorithms in terms of functional computer programs  during the course  biological problems will be introduced and analyzed with the purpose of highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different algorithms  the following topics will be covered    dynamic programming  needleman wunsch  smith waterman  and alignment heuristics data redundancy and homology reduction  hobohm and other clustering algorithms weight matrices  sequence weighting  pseudo count correction for low counts  gibbs sampling  and psi blast hidden markov models  model construction  viterbi decoding  posterior decoding  and baum welsh hmm learning artificial neural networks  architectures and sequence encoding  feed forward algorithm  back propagation and deep neural networks  the course will consist of lectures  discussion sessions and computer exercises  where the students will be introduced to the different algorithms  their implementation and use in analyzing biological problems  in the end of the course  the student will work on a group project were one or more of the algorithms introduced in the course are applied to analyze a biological problem of interest  the project report shall be written as a research paper including an in depth review of the field covered by the project lectures  discussions  exercises and projectto provide the student with an overview and in depth understanding of bioinformatics machine learning algorithms  enable the student to first evaluate which algorithm s  are best suited for answering a given biological question and next implement and develop prediction tools based on such algorithms to describe complex biological problems such as immune system reactions  vaccine discovery  disease gene finding  protein structure and function  post translational modifications etc
