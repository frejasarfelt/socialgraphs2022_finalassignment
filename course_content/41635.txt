the course introduces the participants to the field of robust design  rd  by providing a basic rd toolbox that allows for an analysis of variation effects already in product development and for the design of robust products  based on an introduction to basic rd theory and strategies  the course covers an overview of design approaches  module 1  mobility equations   variation reduction principles   axiomatic design   kinematic principles for systems and interfaces   etc   as well as an introduction to tolerance analysis and engineering statistics  module 2  statistical tolerancing   sensitivity studies   process capability indices   etc    each of the modules is complemented by a hands on workshop session where the participants are provided with a physical case example to try out and test the methods they have been introduced to  furthermore  the course usually features 1 2 guest talks from industry delegates to illustrate the relevance of rd for both large as well as small and medium sized companies lectures  exercises and workshops lecture notes from teachers robust design is a paradigm that aims to improve the quality and reliability of a design  products are exerted to geometrical variation stemming from production tolerances  temperature changes  load conditions  etc  if design is robust  it means that the variance will not have a large impact on functionality or the quality of the product  however  if the design is not robust  sensitive  it could lead to the product not functioning  the product not being able to be assembled  high rejection rates during production  reduced quality for the user  product failures and in some cases product recalls and even fatalities  the typical strategy to deal with variance has been to tighten production tolerances to reduce variance  however this comes at great cost in terms of time  money and resources  by using the robust design methodology you will learn how to reduce the sensitivity of your designs and to not pass on difficult and costly tolerances and process requirements to the production team primarily for students enrolled in the following master programmes  mechanical engineering and design   innovation
