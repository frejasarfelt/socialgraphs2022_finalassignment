the course will include an introduction to specific material properties of wood such as its orthotropic structure  its behaviour under moisture  fire and properties depending on load duration  throughout the course  the student has to design a structure  applying the most typical design methods for wood constructions  lectures are given parallel to the design project and smaller tasks and aspects will be discussed and introduced as support for the project work   some of the major topics are beams  columns  instability problems  supports  displacement  torque  axial forces  transverse tensile  transverse pressure  curved geometries  moisture related pressures forces  connections  nailed  bolted  glued  glued in bolts  and composite structures  furthermore  materials such as normal wood  glulam  clt  cross laminated timber  and wood based plate materials will be introduced   the course will be a combination of short lectures  independent study  design and experimental work in the laboratory   during the semester experimental work in groups on relevant topics will carried out  the experimental work can take place outside the scheduled lectures  each experiment includes preparation  testing and reporting and is part of the overall assessment of the course  the schedule for the experimental work and the hand in of the different reports or assignments will be announced at the beginning of the course   the design project includes the determination of loads according to eurocodes  calculation of structures based on eurocodes and other relevant literature  as well as the production of adequate drawings the course aims are to give the students a basic understanding of using wood as a building material and as structural components
