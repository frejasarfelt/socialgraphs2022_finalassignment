the course deals with refrigeration systems and heat pumps with focus on the most widely used vapour compression cycles  alternative methods such as heat driven cooling and ejector systems are briefly introduced    part of the course is to conduct a design project in a group  in the project a refrigeration plant or heat pump for a chosen application is dimensioned and modelled  this includes overall system modelling of the refrigeration plant as well as detailed modelling of the most important components  evaporator  compressor and condenser     the theory of the course  which is covered in lectures and exercises features     outline of typical cycles and how to model these    refrigerants and safety and environmental issues related to refrigerants    heat transfer calculations in heat exchangers  including an introduction to two phase flow    compressor types and efficiencies    moist air processes    control strategies in refrigeration systems and heat pumpslectures  problem solving  project workthe students are enabled to contribute to the implementation and development of refrigeration systems and heat pumps  such as e g  district heating and cooling systems  cooling and heating of industrial processes  domestic applications  supermarket cooling systems and many more  this is achieved through in depth theory teaching with subsequent project work in which a self selected system is designed  modelled and simulated  both the system level  component level and control strategies are targeted    particular attention is paid to systems based on natural and future proof refrigerants that minimize harmful effects on the ozone layer and the potential for global warming  also  special attention is paid to high efficient systems that help to minimize energy consumption and will play a significant role in the electrification and green conversion of the heating sector for both household and industry
