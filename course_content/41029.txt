this project course immediately follows 41028 design of mechatronic systems 1  in this course  the students will follow a structured design prototyping approach in order to iterate their initial prototypes from design of mechatronic systems 1 into a polished final product  more specifically  the course will cover an introduction to the design process v model  generally recommended for mechatronic systems  and the use of the  prototyping planner  which systematises different prototyping strategies in relation to customer usability  technical feasibility  and commercial viability of the final mechatronic product  students will then apply these elements in their own development project  as all developed products will contain elements for sensing  actuating  and iot capability  the course will furthermore enable the students to integrate standard mechanical  electronic  and it components  as well as self designed and  produced components into full mechatronic system  the participants will work in teams and will use the workshop facilities and laboratories at dtu mechanical engineering  dtu electrical engineering  and dtu skylab to realize their products  the course concludes with a final design review  where each team will present and defend their finished product and hand in their final report assignments and project work in development teams lecture notes from teachers this course extends the work in 41028 design of mechatronic systems 1 and provides a background on the synergy of mechanical engineering  electronic engineering  and information technology for the design of mechantronic systems  the course is essentially relying on a system s thinking approach  and enables the participants to develop a full systems integration prototype  including the choice of standard mechanical  electronic and it components  fabrication of individual components  as well as relevant prototyping strategies a previous participation in 41028 design of mechatronic systems 1 is a requirement for this project course  as it is based on the corresponding results
