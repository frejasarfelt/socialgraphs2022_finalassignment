the course is divided into several modules  each module includes lectures and demonstrations on the relevant topics that are followed by individual exercises  during exercises students practice what was introduced in lecture  students rotate through the modules and complete individual assignments that are documented in a logbook lectures  assignments  individual project work  workshops and presentations prototyping is an essential part of the design process and building physical models enables designer to test ideas and get input from stakeholders  this fundamental course provides an overview of the methods and theories of prototyping   the what  when and why   as well as the practical skills needed for fabrication   the how  students will be introduced to a variety of prototyping skills  including the theoretical knowledge needed to select the most appropriate type of prototype to answer a particular question  best practices for testing prototypes  and how to plan a prototype  students will also develop skills and practice fabricating prototypes  including hands on manual methods  digital modelling and 3d printing  finally  students will learn how to use prototypes to test ideas and use the results to iterate and refine their concepts  in this hands on course  students will learn how to prototype ideas through lectures  exercises  and individual activities only for bachelor students from design   innovation
