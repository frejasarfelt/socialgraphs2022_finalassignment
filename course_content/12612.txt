as far as practically possible the course is based on materials science concepts  so that the students obtain a fundamental understanding of the relationships between structure and properties of concrete  problems of practical use for civil engineers  selection of constituent materials  including properties of cement  flow properties  execution  including production and curing  development of properties as a function of time and temperature  mechanical properties  durability lectures  written excercises to give the students a basic knowledge about the  micro structure and properties of concrete  so that they obtain a sufficient background to    estimate simple relationships between concrete structure  materials  execution  and environmental exposure   select materials for typical concrete structures in consideration of sustainability as well as structural detailing  execution methods  and environmental exposure course 12612 is planed after that the students have obtained knowledge equivalent to the curriculum of course 11562 12603  materials science for civil engineers  prior to the course  hence  it is in course 12612 taken for granted that the students know about chemical reactions and equilibrium of reactions  thermodynamic state parameters  and thermal properties of materials
