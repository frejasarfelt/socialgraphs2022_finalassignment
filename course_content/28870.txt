the focus of this course is on sustainability in relation to energy conversion technologies  we deal with various renewable energy technologies both in respect to technical challenges and opportunities of the technologies and we critically present their pros and cons in respect to general principles of sustainability  the focus is on energy and material flows of relevance to selected renewable energy technologies  mainly based on solar  wind  and biomass  and comparison with fossil based technologies  we will discuss the implications of the interactions between population  energy consumption  living standard and climate change for sustainable development  the selected technologies will be evaluated in a life cycle perspective  different tools for assessment of sustainable development based on energy and material flows will be addressed  including life cycle assessments  carbon footprint and net energy  in addition  it will be discussed how an innovative integration of energy and materials flows between different sectors in society can improve sustainable development  tools and strategies will be used to conceive new solutions to moderns societal challenges and in particular to plan sustainable development of the energy sector in a specific geographic area lectures  work in groups of 4 6 on one assignment which will presented in  1  a project pitch  and 2  a short report reading material consists of papers from journals to be found on dtu learn the course gives insight into various renewable energy technologies  and gives basic information on sustainability and life cycle assessment tools  as well as how energy technologies may contribute to a sustainable future development  this insight will be applied to plan a desirable energy future  further  it can serve as inspiration for how to consider sustainability issues in your later specialization
