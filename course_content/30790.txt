this course deals with some of the most energetic objects and phenomena in the universe  high energy astrophysics is a very active area of modern astronomy  and most of what we know about its objects comes from observational studies  due to the atmospheric absorption of high energy photons  the observations are performed with instruments aboard satellites  the physical processes  thermal or non thermal that produce these energetic photons will be explained  the basic techniques  instrumentation  observational methods  and analysis tools employed to exploit these photons will be touched upon    the course gives further descriptions of the properties  as well as temporal and spectral variations of different astrophysical sources of x rays  examples are supernova remnants  cataclysmic white dwarfs  accretion mechanisms around neutron stars and black holes in x ray binaries  active galaxies harbouring a supermassive black hole in their centre  and gigantic clusters of galaxies lectures and exercises exploring the x ray universe  2nd edition  2010   f d  seward   p a  charles  cambridge university press   supplementary selected material from other books and articles to give an introduction to x ray astrophysics  its methods  its objects  and the involved physical processes
