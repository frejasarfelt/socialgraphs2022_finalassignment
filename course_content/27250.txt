the themes to be presented and discussed are   	regulation and function of bacterial virulence factors including experimental tools to analyze these traits    	toxins and their impacts on the host    	bacterial adhesion mechanisms and tissue invasion mechanisms    	bacterial cell cell communication systems and their roles in pathogenicity    	pathogen metabolism and physiology within infected hosts    	biofilm formation and microbial interactions and how these processes can influence disease progression and treatment outcome    	bacterial adaptation to toxic inhibitors such as antibiotics and host defense molecules    	experimental techniques  e g  bioimaging  in vitro model systems  in vivo models  to study host pathogen interactions    	emerging technologies within synthetic biology  genetic  omics based methods  and nanotechnologies that enable studies of microbial ecology and pathogen physiology in infections    	specific host factors involved in interactions with pathogenic bacteria such as mucosal surfaces and parts of the immune system lecturesthe course focuses on the principles of host pathogen interactions with an emphasis on bacterial diseases of humans  in the course  you will explore and evaluate    	the molecular mechanisms underlining the pathogenesis and drug resistance of important human pathogens    	how new technologies can enable a better understanding of infectious disease progression and host pathogen interactions    	the relationship between progress in our understanding of disease and the development of new or improved diagnostics and treatments   overall  the course aims to give detailed insight into the molecular basis of infectious diseases and the methods used to investigate host pathogen interactions  the course provides a necessary foundation for the design and discovery of new antimicrobials  vaccine development  diagnostic device design and many other areas of medical biotechnology students taking this course may also be interested in 23205  these two courses complement each other well  and you can follow them both  27250 focusses on the molecular basis of infections and technologies to studying host pathogen interactions  and 23205 focusses on current and novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases
