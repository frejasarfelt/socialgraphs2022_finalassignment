the following topics are discussed     several surface representations  for instance  meshes  distance fields  signed and unsigned   skeletal and medial representations  tetrahedral and hexahedral grids  point clouds  etc    spectral analys of triangle meshes using methods that are analogous to fourier analysis    differential geometry properties of discrete surface representations     primitive operations on meshes     simplification and optimization of meshes     registration of point clouds using the icp method    triangulation and manipulation of triangulations     basis functions and of scattered data    approaching geometry processing and analysis through programming    using computer graphics to make geometric data more accessible lectures and databar exercises the aim of this course is to prepare students for problems that require dealing with geometric data such as point clouds  triangle meshes  or surfaces given implicitly as iso contours of scalar fields  such problems include cleaning and merging data from optical scanners  modeling surfaces from scattered points  generating geometry algorithmically  and meshing for fem simulation  informed by this larger goal  the immediate objectives are to familiarise students with representations for geometric data and to introduce a range of algorithms for processing geometric data  converting between representations  and visualising geometric data   the practical work consists of weekly assignments solved in python
