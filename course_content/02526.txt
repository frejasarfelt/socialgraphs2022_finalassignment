the main content of the course is to solve specific cases with associated problems  for each case a problem has to be analyzed  the mathematical model must be described and implemented on a computer  and calculations and simulations must be done  which illustrates the relevance of the model  all of this has to be reported in a structured manner  the methods will fall within discrete mathematics  image analysis  differential equations  materials science  operations research  and scientific computing  the course include peer grading of other students reports  which is a prerequisite for being examinedlectures  exercises and reportsmathematical modeling is a prerequisite in solving the majority of technical problems  a typical solution is found by first formulating a mathematical model that is implemented on a computer  and after that a lab scale experiment is set up and finally a real world solution is made  the ability to formulate a relevant mathematical model  which can be implemented in a computer and provide useful information is a fundamental prerequisite for modern engineering  in this course the student will get tools for setting up a mathematical model  carry out simulations and calculations on these models  and perform a critical analysis and report the obtained results the course is a prerequisite for the following advanced courses  02610 optimization and datafitting  02614 high performance computing  02616 large scale modeling  02623 finite element methods for partial differential equations  02685 scientific computing for differential equations  the course is reserved for students from mathematics and technology and general engineering  and other students are welcome if there are available seats
