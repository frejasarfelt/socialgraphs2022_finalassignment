the ph d  course consists of 3 parts   part i  programming fortran part ii  introduction to openmp part iii  mpithe phd  course consists of 2 3 hours lecture per day and 2 3 hours exercises fortran is one of the principal languages used in scientific  numerical and engineering programming and knowledge in fortran is an indispensible qualification for students  researchers  and engineers  with the two recent revisions of the language  the power of the language has been progressively enhanced  and most vendors  ibm  hp  sgi  intel  sun  cray  provide highly optimizing fortran compilers  based on more than 50 years of experience    mpi  message passing interface  is the de facto standard for programming portable message passing parallel applications on networked computers  also known as clusters   mpi has bindings to c c   and fortran  and it is available on all massively parallel supercomputers    openmp  open multi processing  is a standard application programming interface  api  that supports multi platform shared memory multiprocessing programming in c c   and fortran  it consists of a set of compiler directives  library routines  and environment variables that enable shared memory parallelism and execution   the current and the future supercomputers consist of a cluster of computers  nodes  each with  multiple processing cores  dual  quad  multicore  that share the memory of the node    the goal of the course it to outline strategies for porting and writing efficient  portable  maintainable code for such hybrid computer archictectures
