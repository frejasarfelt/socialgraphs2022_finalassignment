motivation  the complexity of networked cps safety critical systems is growing at a very high pace and their constraints in terms of metrics such as performance  reliability  cost and time to market are getting tighter  therefore  the task of designing and configuring such systems is becoming increasingly important and difficult at the same time  the design  i e   deciding the components of a system architecture  and configuration tasks  i e   deciding how to allocate software functions to the architecture components  are intractable problems  supported software tools  these tools use optimization techniques to search for solutions that optimize competing design metrics  the course covers the optimization of complex cps  with a focus on networked cps  such as those found in the automotive  avionics  space  industrial areas   content   definition of optimization problems and motivation for systems optimization  introduction of real world optimization problems via selected scientific articles and book chapters  presentation of selected optimization techniques  integer programming  constraint programming  meta heuristics  such as genetic algorithms  tabu search  simulated annealing  grasp  greedy randomized adaptive search procedures   etc   implementation exercises solving a simple optimization problem using one of the presented techniques  selection of optimization problem and technique  project  implementation and evaluation of the selected optimization technique on test caseslectures and projectselected scientific articles presenting system optimization problems selected book chapters on modelling and design of cyber physical networked systems selected chapters from  burke  edmund k   and graham kendall  search methodologies  springer science  business media  incorporated  2005  isbn 978 1 4614 6940 7many embedded computer systems control physical entities  having to coordinate between computation and physical resources  in this context  they are referred to as cyber physical systems  cps   when these cyber physical systems become interconnected with each other and with the internet  they are called the internet of things  iot   forming  the infrastructure of the information society   networked cps are the infrastructure that underpins our smart society  smart energy grid  smart cities  smart and green mobility  smart manufacturing  etc    providing solutions for several societal challenges   the course enables the participants to  understand and use the concepts and terminology in the field of cps optimization  understand  implement and evaluate the different cps optimization methods available  analyze and optimize large scale complex cps   the students can choose their own project topic from a list of real world cyber physical systems optimization challenges introduced via selected scientific papers  the main concepts related to systems modelling  analysis and optimization will be introduced via in class exercises  the students will implement a systems optimization method of their choice  introduced via the course literature and lectures  and apply it on the provided test cases
