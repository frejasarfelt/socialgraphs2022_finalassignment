the course consists of four parts  1 photonic devices for power generation  2 light emitting diodes for solid state illumination  3 light management for maximum efficiency  4 solid state illumination  we start from presenting the principle of operation of photovoltaic devices including analysis of their ideal power conversion efficiency   we will then discuss the performance of the real devices and analyse the factors limiting their efficiency compared with the ideal case   various technologies  present and future  and materials will be included in comparison    in a second part of the course we will discuss specific issues of design and operation of light emitting diodes needed for solid state illumination   materials and strategies for achieving high efficiency and high power of emission at visible light wavelengths will be analysed   future trends in this rapidly changing subject will be presented as well as the current ones   light management in both types of devices is a key element for achieving high efficiency   optics  micro optics and chip level strategies for efficient light coupling into the photovoltaic devices and light out coupling from the leds will be discussed   modelling of optical components of the systems will be included  based on understanding both the leds and optics we will present strategies for white light generation used in solid state illumination   the students will have the opportunity to learn about photometry  which analyses light as seen by human eye and about colour measurement lectures  problem solving  laboratory exercisesphotonic devices  which by definition convert energy between electrical and optical find more and more applications in the sphere of energy saving and renewable energy generating devices      in this course we want to discuss physics  materials  design and operation rules specific to photovoltaic devices and leds for solid state illumination teachers   paul michael petersen   ris√∏ campus  building 130  ph    45 46774512   pape fotonik dtu dk  haiyan ou   lyngby campus  building 345a  ph    45  4525 3782   haou fotonik dtu dk  yiyu ou  lyngby campus  building 345a  ph    45  4525 6637   yiyo fotonik dtu dk
