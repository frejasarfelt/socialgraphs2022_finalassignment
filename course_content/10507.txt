quantum mechanical description of the physics and chemistry of clean surfaces  including the electronic and structural properties  description of electron structure of adsorbates of the surface  epitaxy  adsorption desorption mechanisms  chemisorption and the dynamics of chemical and physical reactions  description of the prerequisite for experimental studies of these surfaces under well defined conditions   this is ultra high vacuum  uhv  with base pressures below 10e 13 bar  the most popular methods  e g  x ray photoelectron spectroscopy  xps   auger electron spectroscopy  aes   ion scattering spectroscopy  iss   low energy electron diffraction  leed   electron microscopy  em  and scanning probe microscopy  afm and stm  will also be described  furthermore  fundamental aspects of heterogeneous catalysis especially in connection with the future energy production will be analysed  all the above mentioned methods will be discussed by use of a combination of lectures  exciting new research and application papers  lectures on innovation processes and proposal writing  a visit to the industry is also enclosed lectures  oral presentations  evaluation of reports and proposal preparation book   concepts of modern catalysis and kinetics  by ib chorkendorff and hans niematverdriet  isbn  978352733268 7 obs 3rd edition   additional notes will be submitted as pdf files to give the students knowledge of the atomic scale physics prevailing at the interface between solid and gas liquid phases  this is of fundamental importance if you want to understand technologically important processes  e g  catalysis  adhesion  tribology  and mechanical and chemical properties of new nanomaterials  the course aims at giving the students an overview of the most applied methods and an introduction to how these can be used to study realistic problems within the surface physics area  the students will also be given classes in how to write proposals and gaining insight into innovative aspects especially with the goal of initiating spin off companies  an important part of this course is to combine the acquired knowledge with phenomena in energy conversion  formulating scientific questions based on critical review of relevant literature and eventually writing a proposals for funding such projects based on relevant calls
