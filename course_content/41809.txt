the course is given partly as theoretical lectures and partly as computer exercises using ansys mechanical apdl  ansys parametric design language   the stiffness method is taken as a starting point to introduce the finite element method  fem   topics related to the choice of element types  mesh development  equation solving  introducing boundary conditions  and result presentation are in focus  the exercises guide the student through the main steps of building the analysis model  creating meshes  applying boundary conditions  solution and result presentation for a range of problems  the course prepares the students to conduct finite element analyses through the development of own text based apdl input files for ansys mechanical apdl  in the last third of the semester  project work is conducted  focusing on applying finite element analysis to an engineering problem of practical importance lectures  exercises with tutorials and own text based input files as well as project work the project work are performed in groups of three persons  for the report students have to declare which parts of the work each group member is responsible for to give the student a basic understanding of computer based modeling by applying finite element analysis  fea  to problems of engineering interest  the course takes offset in mechanical problems  but fe analysis applies to both classical disciplines  fluidmechanics  thermomechanics  and electromechanics  and new  additive manufacturing  biomechanics and life science   more specifically  the course objective is to give the student     understanding of the basic theoretical background for finite element analysis     experience using a commercial finite element program for the analysis of strength related problems  this is for example relevant to enable significant weight reductions in mechanical structures and  thus  to facilitate green solutions and ensure environmental sustainability   the student obtains an understanding of the possibilities and restrictions related to commercial finite element programs  e g  valuable in the pursuit of industry 4 0 and digital twins the course is running together with the course 41812 in first two thirds of the semester the course content is focused on applied finite element analysis of constructions using bar  beam  and continuum elements  the course is running together with the course 41812 in the first two thirds of the semester
