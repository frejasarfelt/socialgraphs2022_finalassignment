many interesting optimization problems cannot be solved using standard solvers dues to their size and complexity   a pragmatic approach to optimization is to use tailored computer algorithms to test a large number of solutions in order to find a good feasible solution  such algorithms are called heuristics  those algorithms do not guarantee to find optimal solutions but attempt to identify good solutions  there exist a number of more general algorithmic frameworks which can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems  those are the so called meta heuristics  in this course a number of these meta heuristics will be presented     simulated annealing   genetic algorithms evolutionary algorithms   tabu search   grasp   alns  as this field is constantly developing  the content of the course is constantly updated  the exercises in the course will be in the computing language julia  hence prior experience with julia is an advantage lectures  excercises and project work to give a thorough introduction to the use of metaheuristics for optimization for solving real world optimizaton problems  where a trade off is necessary between solution quality and solution time note  registration to the course is guaranteed during the regular registration period  registration during the supplementary registration period will be allowed so long as there is space in the classroom  once the room space is exceeded the registration will close and will not open again
