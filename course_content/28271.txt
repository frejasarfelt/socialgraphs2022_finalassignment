the course is structured in three main parts    biomass resource and product characterization   gasification  pyrolysis and applications   sustainability and reporting the biomass resource and characterization part focuses on biomass as a renewable energy source and its different conversion paths for energy applications  besides  challenges that occur during thermal biomass conversion will be discussed that can be related to the biomass structure  the products  such as bio oil or biochar and their characterization possibilities will be introduced and the students will apply these in their experimental work  including proximate analysis  elemental analysis  gc and gc ms analysis  karl fisher titration  bet analysis   the gasification and applications part builds upon the biomass gasification process and technology fundamentals  state of the art gasification technologies  gas cleaning  heat and power and biofuel applications will be presented and discussed to provide a broad overview of the technologies potential  simple calculations of gas composition  mass balance and energy balance for selected gasifiers will be carried out  lab experiments on stepwise thermal conversion with pyrolysis and gasification of  biomass are also included  sustainability and reporting deals with the full value chain of bioenergy to energy materials  this includes the use of biochar as a fertilizing and soil improving product that also provide carbon sequestration  enough time is given during the course to work on the report of lab experiments results from the first two parts  in addition  students will be given an assignment  based on biomass gasification thermodynamic equilibrium modelling in ees  whose results need to be presented in a mini conference the last day of the course lectures  student presentations  lab experiments  practical assignments and group workthere is a great need to develop efficient and sustainable energy technologies that can utilize the limited amount of available biomass and wastes  thermal gasification and pyrolysis are promising technology platforms that can increase the conversion efficiency and availability of biomass  including several difficult low value fuels  from a variety of sectors in the society  by producing e g  high efficient power and district heating and or biofuels  the course will provide a hands on approach and an overview to the process and products of thermal gasification and pyrolysis of biomass by including pilot scale experimental exercises followed by chemical characterization of the products  this enables the students to evaluate and assess complex aspects of sustainability in connection to production of bioenergy and associated technical challenges   including handling and characterization of biomass resources  stepwise thermal conversion and utilization of resulting biochar ashes as fertilizing and soil improving products that can be used in future farming systems and as a carbon capture and sequestration agent  the students will also be presented with the current research activities in the research group and be introduced to the main challenges associated with pyrolysis  gasification and sustainability aspects of biomass today
