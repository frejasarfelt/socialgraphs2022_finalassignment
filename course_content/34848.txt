in the course an industrial partner will pose a technical challenge for sound propagation and effects in microacoustic devices  students will work together in group projects to find solutions for the challenge  they will employ analytical and numerical methods to describe sound generation and propagation in order to find optimized design parameters  proposed solutions will be evaluated in close cooperation with company engineers  prototype designs may be realized using additive manufacturing group project work in a 3 weeks period to bring the student in contact with current research and innovation challenges faced by a partner from the audio and hearing aid industry  to get insight into specific issues in microacoustics  to understand  analyze  and solve a well defined acoustic engineering problem within a short deadline the course content will be linked to research activities at camm   centre for acoustic mechanical microsystems  www camm elektro dtu dk   the students will get into contact and work with engineers from an industrial camm partner general competence course in msc engineering acoustics with innovation and technological specialization content
