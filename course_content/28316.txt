in small teams the participants carry out approximately 5 exercises within the topics  colloids  including dispersions  macromolecular solutions and micelles  and surfaces  through independent exercises combined with relevant literature the possibilities and limitations for different measuring techniques  the exercises are closely linked to ongoing research  among the topics that the exercises can cover are a o  emulsion stability  capillarity  surface tension  contact angle  micro emulsion  interfacial tension  rheology and solubilization  reports are prepared on all exercises  finally  there is a common presentation and discussion session  where we will discuss each exercise planning and performance of laboratory exercises with subsequent data analysis and reportingin order to support the understanding of colloid systems as well as interfacial phenomena in multiphase systems the participants learn about relevant types of measurements  these systems are highly complex and experimental investigation and testing is very common in companies that produce colloid products and products that are based on interfacial phenomena  this is true for the paint  food  pharmaceutical  and many other industries  the overall objective of the course is to give the participants an understanding of a range of phenomena within colloid and surface chemistry with the use of experimental methods of industrial importance the course is normally taken immediately after the course 28315
