drug development is a complex process requiring disciplines ranging from early target identification and validation through safety and efficacy testing to market launch  this course will provide the students with an understanding of the most basic and important aspects of this process with a strong focus on preclinical drug development  emphasis is put on solubility dissolution  cell studies  toxicology testing and animal studies of drug candidates  there will also be lectures on pharmacology screening  clinical studies and on translational medicine etc  the course will cover development of small molecules as well as biopharmaceuticals and create an overview of the entire preclinical drug development phase  several lectures are from experienced experts from the pharmaceutical industry as novo nordisk  lundbeck  leo pharma and janssen pharmaceutica  they will give lectures covering  real world  challenges in drug development  the course will include interactive lectures  presentations by students as well as team work on specific drug development challenges  this work will be presented by each group who will also act as opponent for another group lectures  team work  journal discussions  oral presentations  the load between lectures and team work is approximately 50 50 selected chapters from the textbook of pharmaceutical medicine  7th edition  2013   and selected international peer reviewed research and review papers the overall purpose of this course is to provide the student with a broad overview of and the ability to understand the various stages of the preclinical development process and what it takes for a drug candidate to go into clinical trials and potentially enter the market  the stages from discovery to where a drug candidate is selected for clinical trials will be covered with a main focus on the development phase  the course will illustrate the process of developing the optimal drug candidate by combining knowledge on pharmacology  pharmaceutical sciences  engineering perspectives  toxicology as well as computer modelling  focus will be on development of small molecules as well as biopharmaceuticals and on many cases from  real life  from industry and academia  such knowledge is mandatory for the candidate s ability to interact with other professionals in multidisciplinary project teams within pharmaceutical companies the course is identical to the now cancelled 23281 preclinical drug development
