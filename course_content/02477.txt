content may vary from year to year but typically covers  machine learning  bayesian decision theory  mathematical modelling of pattern recognition systems   approximate inference using sampling and variational methods  evaluation and test to provide unbiased performance measures  and bayesian modeling for audio  image and text data using deep learning structures lectures and exercises  the exercises will be a mix of theoretical exercises and hands on exercise in python1  kevin murphy   probabilistic machine learning  advanced topics  mit press  2023 https   probml github io pml book book2 html  2  christopher m  bishop   pattern recognition and machine learning   springer  2006  isbn 0 38 731073 8 https   www microsoft com en us research people cmbishop prml book    3  papers and notesmachine learning is fundamental to artificial intelligence because learning flexible statistical models from data has emerged as the currently best way to scale ai to near human level performance in applications to for example images  natural language and speech  careful modeling of all contributions to uncertainty is the key to theoretical understanding and successful applications  with more flexible models such as those used in deep learning this becomes increasingly important but also difficult  in the course  bayesian machine learning is used as it provides a unified approach to reason about uncertainty associated with both the data and the specification of the model   the purpose of the course is two fold  first of all  the goal is to equip students with a deeper theoretical understanding of probabilistic machine learning and to enable them to read and understand the newest research literature in the field  second  to enable students to discuss probabilistic models for practical problems and to discuss and apply appropriate inference algorithms this course forms together with course 02460 and course 02456 the advanced courses in the area of machine learning  the corresponding introductory course is 02450
