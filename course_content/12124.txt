urban flooding  advanced gis analysis  urban drainage systems  mike   1d 2d hydrodynamic models  expected annual damage a mixture of lectures and group work  the course requires active participation in group work and discussions in class  a central part of the course is unsupervised group work in the data bar on various cases  during this time the groups are expected to help each other towards understanding and solving the problems at hand to enable participants to model what happens once rain events exceed the capacity of the urban drainage systems and the assumptions for modelling the storm water runoff with hydrodynamic pipe models no longer holds  to do this  the participants will learn how to extend a mike pipe model with a 2 dimensional hydrodynamic surface model  mike  and to understand the uncertainties related to this sort of models  finally the participants will learn how to perform urban flood risk assessments including the definitions of hazards  vulnerabilities  and exposure  it is assumed  that students are familiar with basic gis analysis and formats used by the arcgis software  as well as with the application of 1d hydrodynamic models the teaching in january 2021 will be held on campus  preference will be given to students who need the course as prerequisite for their master thesis
