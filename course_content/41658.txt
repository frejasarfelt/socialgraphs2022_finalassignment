the course starts with lectures on the physical mechanisms of the interaction of waves  electrons and particles with the solid state at a level that is sufficient to understand the principles of the analysis techniques to be discussed  the principles of different analysis techniques  microscopy  diffraction and spectroscopy  will be treated in relation to their application in materials science and technology  the possibilities  impossibilities  complementarities and limitations of the various techniques are demonstrated with realistic examples and supplemented by literature studies  the students are expected to participate actively in case studies and discussions lectures and case studiesthe microstructure of materials is fully described by the morphology and the distribution of phases constituting the material  a wealth of techniques exists for characterisation of the morphology  identification of constituent phases  their distribution and composition  an overview is given of the most widely applied characterisation techniques for microstructures  light optical microscopy  lom   scanning and transmission electron microscopy  sem tem   scanning and atom probe microscopy  x ray diffraction  xrd   electron backscatter diffraction  ebsd   electron probe x ray microanalysis  epma   auger electron spectroscopy  aes   x ray spectroscopy  x ray photoelectron spectroscopy  xps  and other spectroscopic techniques  it is the purpose of the course that the students learn to evaluate the suitability of the various techniques for materials characterization and can find an optimal combination of analysis techniques that gives an answer to microstructure related problems in applied materials science and engineering
