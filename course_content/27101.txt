this course will provide the basic concepts for describing assay performance  will show how assays can be validated and how different types of assays can be used for different types of problems  in addition  the principles and applications of different types of assays will be demonstrated  including immuno based assays  cellular assays  and quantitative molecular biology based assays  pcr type assays   also signal generation methods including fluorescence and chemiluminescence will be explained  finally  the principles behind the selection and application of different assays in the process from discovery to the clinical use of pharmaceuticals will be discussed the course will be a combination of practical laboratory exercises  lectures and group work the course will teach the application and evaluation of assays used in the chain from discovery the clinical use of  bio pharmaceuticals with emphasis on how and why different assays are used at specific steps in the pipeline  basic assay principles  concepts and statistics for validation and development of assays and for evaluation of results will be discussed  and various types of equipment and technologies used for assay measurements will be presented  the laboratory exercises will demonstrate the use  practical execution  and analysis of examples of assays the participants have to bring their own lab coat and safety glasses pharmaceutical design and engineering students have priority as this course is  mandatory  specialization  for these students   the participants have to bring their own lab coat and safety glasses
