the students will learn programming and prototyping from a human computer interaction perspective  being able to create and relate a detailed microcontroller program to a real world situation  the course will provide the basic skills towards independent prototyping  i e  how to interface to electronics and how to program complex behaviours that make use of the electronics  the students will also learn to reflect on the behaviour of the prototype with respect to the user evaluation  towards producing functional and situation appropriate prototypes class lectures and exercises in programming  final exam project the goal of the course is to give a basic understanding of physical computing and how different forms of interaction  e g  voice  sound  pressure  can be used in human machine scenarios
