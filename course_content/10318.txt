the first half of the course introduces the basic concepts in many body theory  the material is based on the text book  introduction to quantum field theory in condensed matter physics   by h  bruus and k  flensberg  furthermore  the needed mathematical techniques are developed  the second half of the course concentrates on physical applications  such as  excited states  plasmons and excitons  in bulk and low dimensional materials  the basic microscopic theory of superconductivity  and the berry phase and some its implications  the material is fetched from the above text book  problem sets on special topics  and from current scientific literature lectures  group work  exercisesbruus   flensberg  many body quantum theory in condensed matter physics  oxford university press  2016 the technology to fabricate optical electronic devices based on nanostructures and low dimensional materials is progressing rapidly  these systems possess  apart from forming the basis for future electronic components  many fascinating physical properties and research in this field is a central topic in modern condensed matter physics  the theoretical description requires advanced techniques based on many body theory  e g   green functions and diagrammatic perturbation theory   the general goal of this course is to give the student some general acquaintance with these analytical techniques and their applications to relevant systems  as well as an overview of the basic physics  this course also gives sufficient background knowledge for further studies of many body physics  including a short resume of complex analysis  residue calculus  this is an advanced course in theoretical many body physics in the solid state  which is aimed at students on the last part of their master s program
