oil and gas production makes a significant contribution to the danish economy  the oportunity to produce obviously depends on the technological conditions  e g  the behavior of hydrocarbons under pressure and temperature  the different reservoir types and the applied production technology  but the economy of the projects are severely affected by the choice of technological solutions  the course focuses on the interplay between technology and economy  a number of lectures are given by visiting lecturers from the oil industry  the technological part consists of e short description of reservoir types and recovery processes  further more drilling technology  production platforms and ships  selection of materials  corrosion and other production problems are described  in connections with production systems the utility and safety systems  instrumentation and communication systems  ad well as safety and environmental aspects are covered  in the economic part the expenses for exploration  capital  and operational as well as rate of return on investment are discussed for the special conditions of oil and gas production with emphasis on offshore production including the legal terms and conditions  during the course the economic impact of the technical solutions will be emphasized lectures  exercises  and team work projects the course gives students from all fields of engineering an understanding of the technical and economical conditions governing the oil and gas industry  the complexity of the business and the need for a broad range of technical skills is illustrated  the participants will become familiar with the terminology of the various disciplines related to oil and gas production to a level that facilitates the communication with industry specialists  the course forms the basis for further studies in petroleum technology at dtu  including thesis projects in all engineering fields  issues of responsible and sustainable production are addressedthe course is open for all engineering educations
