the course introduces the student to two essential areas for design  namely environmental thinking and product life design  environmental problems are introduced to the students from both a historical and a future oriented perspective and the student is supplied with techniques for the mapping and design of product life cycles   the course is theoretically based and has the aim that the student both understands and has a critical opinion of the taught theory  and furthermore makes an effort to supplement the theoretical basis material with additional sources    the key methods and theories explored in the course are  sustainable development  corporate sustainability  circular economy  product life thinking  reference model for ecodesign  meco matrix  ecodesign strategies and guidelines  environmental management systems  as well as design methods for the sustainable development goals   three tasks guide the students through the teaching syllabus and ensure that the students demonstrate their abilities to both understand and to further communicate the material     the first task is a multiple choice examination  which tests the students  knowledge and understanding of the course syllabus     the second task requires the students to write a scientific paper  where the students are supplied with a template and the game rules for a typical conference paper  subjects for the paper are chosen from a list of suggestions from the teaching group and shall form the basis for the discussions in the paper  by use of the course s own and other external references  this task is carried out as a single person task     the third task is based around an evaluation of an ecodesign task  each student receives a task description  which shall be evaluated within 3 hours  the students are evaluated according to their ability to submerge themselves in the theory  to evaluate the environmental contents and to give a critical evaluation of the task  this task is carried out as a single person task lectures  exercises and project workliterature list delivered at course startthis course has the following main goals     to give insight into tools for handling environmental problems in connection with the design of products and product life systems    to introduce environmental issues into the activity of product life design    to identify and analyse relevant environmental and resource related opportunities within circular economy    to analyse product life cycles  especially with respect to the involvement of relevant stakeholders    to use methodical tools for product life oriented design  dfx  with a particular focus on ecodesign    to generate scenarios and strategies for the realisation of improved environmental situations  in relation to products and usage situations
