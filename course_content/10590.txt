the students will choose catalytic systems and scientific instruments used in their own projects to use as a system to visualize while learning to use blender    for learning  the students will   find tutorials on blender on the internet  and   be given examples of python scripts to incorporate the atomic simulation environment  ase  to generate surfaces  nanoparticles and crystal structures in blender   depending on how fast the students learn blender  they will start with static images and work towards more advanced blender concepts like particle trajectories  motion  and animations  the individual students will work on their own illustration projects and the course will end in a session where each participant presents his or hers illustrations lectures    computer exercisesexamples from teacher  blender fundamentals 2 80  video lessons   concepts of modern catalysis by ib chorkendorff if a brush up on surface physics is needed for more advanced models for many applications in science  it is important to present visually pleasant and informative illustrations   examples could be    an abstract figure in a journal paper to concisely convey the topic or motivation    a result or discussion figure in a journal paper to precisely summarize important results or messages    illustrations of scientific instruments used to conduct research   a good figure can impress and add realism to funding applications  ease the description of an instrument when writing a paper or dissertation  and lift powerpoint presentations   the contents of this course will give the students insight into using blender 3d modeling software for illustrations in science
