see the learning objectives lesson and written test once a week  in total 4 hours   the teacher presents theory  the students calculate small problems and carry out small experiments  the problems should be hand in and approved  there will be small written tests without aids  in total  there will be about 9 5 hours of work per week including the lessons web based teaching material produced by the teacher the students are given a thorough and detailed understanding of fundamental electrophysics and will be able to derive almost all mathematical details and explain the physical relationships using 3d illustrations  the student will be able to solve problems in theoretical and experimental situations  the course describes static and dynamic charges  electric fields and polarization of materials  the student will thereby acquire a scientific understanding of electronic and electro technical components and natural phenomena  this enables the student to understand other courses and to be creative and innovative   the students will acquire an understanding of materials that can be used for electrotechnical purposes   for each chapter there is a detailed list of learning objectives  this list is arranged in a questionnaire with formulas  figures and examples  the student must be able to explain the objectives in written form in the tests and assignments and in oral form at the exam the course is quite comprehensive and provides an excellent basis for further studies of high voltage electrical engineering and electrotechnique  the course is a prerequisite for a large number of other courses within electrotechnique and optional courses like general  and electrochemistry   the students carry out small written tests without aids  for each test it is   in principle   possible for the students to see the questions in advance and thereby prepare answers before the test  however  a part of the test may be changed without informing the students the previous course 62745  10 ects  electrophysics and materials has been split up into two new courses  62773 electrophysics 1  5 ects  62774 electrophysics 2  5 ects
