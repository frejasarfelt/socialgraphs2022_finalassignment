the course deals with environmental exposure and effect assessment of organic chemicals  exposure and effect assessments are key elements in both danish and eu classifications and risk assessments of chemicals  the exposure assessment covers the environmental chemical fate i e  transport  degradation  intermedia transfer and partitioning of chemicals in different parts of the environment  here processes like biodegradation  hydrolysis  photodegradation  sorption  volatilization  and bioaccumulation are fundamental for understanding the environmental behaviour of chemicals  the processes are related to the physico chemical and chemical structure properties and to the characteristics of the environmental compartments  water  aquatic sediments  aquatic biota  soil  and air   calculation exercises and computer based models for distribution of compounds are used to illustrate the environmental chemical fate  the effect assessment covers ecotoxicological effects of chemicals  this subject is taught through lectures dealing with the theoretical aspects of toxicity testing and regulatory use of toxicity data  furthermore  collection of chemical property data and a series of theoretical and practical laboratory exercises are carried out in groups of 3 students  the laboratory exercises include standard tests for biodegradation and biological effects on different groups of organisms  e g  bacteria  algae and crustaceans  lectures  laboratory exercises in groups  computer exercises and calculation exercisesas teaching materials is used a  set of notes  composed by teachers own notes supplemented with relevant literature to provide a general basic knowledge of environmental chemistry and ecotoxicology as a fundamental basis for understanding chemical pollution problems  tools for evaluation of environmental fate and effects of chemicals are introduced in the context of environmental management and risk assessment students on the master of environmental technology have priority if the number of students exceed the max  numberams course if only few student sign up for exam this may be performed as an oral exam course 12236
