the systematic framework for process design consists of the following tasks  which is applied to a selected process design case study  task 1  collect information on the product  task 2  collect information on the process  alternative paths to convert other raw materials to the desired product task 3  generate and or select preliminary process flowsheet   task 4  perform mass balance  decide process conditions  such as reaction conversion  separation factor  purge  etc   and model each unit using simple models and perform mass balance  task 5  perform energy balance   i  set temperatures and pressures on the process flowsheet streams  based on heuristics or information analysis in previous tasks    ii  with t and p set for each stream  perform a simple mass   energy balance using the same  using the simulator   task 6  refine and consolidate mass and energy balances   i   convert each of the simple models with the more rigorous counterpart  one at a time  until all simple models have been converted  task 7  estimate cost of the project including capital and production cost  based on the simulation results from task 6  this task needs appropriate equipment sizing for costing calculations   task 8  perform an economic evaluation using various profitability metrics based on capital and production cost estimates in task 7 given for the  base case  design  task 9  perform heat integration and explore opportunities for heat and mass integration  recycle   if yes  apply them   reassess potential economic improvement  redo task 9  against base case  task 10  process flowsheet optimization  formulate relevant optimization problem and seek if potential economic improvement exist by optimized unit operation or flowsheet operation  reassess potential economic improvement with the optimized solution  redo task 8     task 11  perform sustainability analysis of the base case design and explore opportunities to improve environmental footprint  e g  co2 footprint  odp  ap  etc  of the base case design  e g  consider changing a solvent  using alternative unit operations  etc   reassess the potential improvement by doing simulations and redoing task 8    the final outcome combining the results of all tasks are compiled in a design project report to be presented in the final project report lectures  examples and exercises on systematic methods and tools for process design in classroom  project assignment and group work in databar computer classroom chemical process design is about finding a sustainable process that can convert the raw materials to the desired products cost effectively  chemical engineers support diverse range of sectors and process industries  which convert raw materials to more than 70 000 products  given this diverse set of industries and sectors with its own domain specific equipment and standards  in this course  the objective is to introduce students to systematic methods for process design  to give overview of the main steps involved in typical life cycle of a process design  as well as the complexity of the design activity  in addition to systematic approach for process design  we stress the importance of iterative process analysis including economics  uncertainty   sensitivity analysis of design assumptions and basis  heat integration  optimization as well as sustainability analysis of conceptual process design  in this way  the course aims to equip students with a flexible skillset to help design innovative  cost competitive and sustainable processes in diverse range of processing industries textbook   systematic methods of chemical process design   l t  biegler  i e  grossmann  a w  westerberg  prentice hall  1997  isbn  0 13 492422 3  supporting texbook  especially for cost and economic evaluation  plant design and economics for chemical engineers 5th edition by max peters   klaus timmerhaus   ronald west   max peters
