a road must be able to last for many years of traffic  in recent times  roads have also begun to be used for temporary storage and infiltration of rainwater so that the worst effects of cloudburst are averted  the course ensures competences within the construction and dimensioning of a traditional road pavement  with additional knowledge of permeable pavements  road construction   materials  gravel  bottom protection grid  bearing layer and as bearing layer   asphalt  concrete   the road structure   calculating  mmopp    basis layer  proctor test  marshall test  on an asphalt lab    operation and maintenance  pavement management  monitoring  laping  change of wear  snow removal  salting    supply  aab  sab  drawings  supplementary studies   execution  methods  machinery  building materials  soil work  water   drainage of roads   quality of rainwater from roads and other surfaces  the effect of  winter control    methods for local water treatment   the effect of drainage of rainwater to recipients and groundwater   permeable pavements   why implement permeable pavements  flat surfaces  without slope   rainfall delay  rainwater drainage    materials  permeable asphalt  cobblestone  permeable concrete blocks  permeable bearing layer  permeable subgrade   structure  infiltration of all water  partial infiltration  no drainage   design and calculating  selection of solution  pollution and drinking water interests  determine volume of water that can be infiltratet  delayed   operation and maintenance   executionlectures  exercises  course projects  company visitsthe aim of the course is that the student acquires knowledge and skills in designing  calculating and execution of the construction of a road as well as operation and maintenance of the road  in addition  it is the goal that the student will obtain the skills to evaluate the quality and quantity of surface water originating from roads and other surfaces with respect to the delay of the water  infiltration and   or discharge to recipients  in addition  the student should be able to evaluate methods for the possible treatment of rainwater  the course s goal is also that the student acquires knowledge and skills in designing  calculating and execution of road pavements that can be used for delay and infiltration of rainwater  including evaluating the suitability of the various pavements in this regard
