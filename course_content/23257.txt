this course gives an interdisciplinary introduction to compositional data analysis and modeling  while the course will mainly be anchored in applications to genomic data analysis  we will  throughout the course  draw examples from a variety of other topics   we will work through the mathematical framework during lectures and apply the techniques to real world examples during hand on exercises 50  lectures  50  hands on exercisethis course introduces to the mathematical tools that are required to analyze  visualize  and interpret genomic  compositional  count data  data  which describes proportions  counts  percentages  or concentrations are compositional and cannot be analyzed as real multivariate data  however  using appropriate transformations  compositional data can be projected into a multivariate real space  on which we can use all available standard multivariate methods   the objectives of this course are to let the students understand the mathematical principles behind compositions  and asses the quality of genomic data  the students will learn how to perform explorative data analysis and visualize compositions  and finally how to use standard statistical methods in a compositional framework  apart from the study of genomics  compositional data are encountered in broad range of study fields  e g   geology  chemistry  political sciences  environmental studies  health science  etc   and this course is therefore relevant for any student who has an interest in general data science students are expected to have prior knowledge of linear algebra and statistics  and basic programing skills in python  r or matlab  towards the end of the course  students will pick a compositional data set  which they will analyze and visualize based on the techniques they have learned  the result should be handed in as a written report and students will present their reports as part of an individual oral examination
