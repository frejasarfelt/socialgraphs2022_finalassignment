this course will cover the following aspects     importance of materials  processes  and mechanical factors  and environmental sustainability aspects  in construction design  e g  for a specific application such as car body  how the performance of the car depends on above mentioned factors     how to select materials for a specific application depending on the property and performance needed for construction  a generalized material selection strategy will be introduced together with use of material property charts  computer aided selection  and case studies     how to find structured information on materials and processes for material selection  how to screen information on materials and arrive at a conclusion  how to create hybrid materials with combined properties of two or three materials     component structural failures due to improper materials choice and bad construction   case studies  detailed survey of typical real life examples of failures from different applications   lectures and videos      present material scenario  performance requirements  and future trends in important technological sectors      transportation    microelectronics    bio medical    building    packaging    high temperature    industrial applications   the course includes few guest lectures by experts who have industrial and commercial experience in various aspects  these lectures will be conducted either in person or by webinar using an internet platform    the course will have short projects to identify suitable material combinations for a particular application using material selection strategy lectures  independent study and tutorialsthis course aims to develop comprehensive knowledge on how to select materials for a wide range of constructions and products in engineering applications  following this course  the students will have a deep understanding of  a  the methodology of materials selection b  use of computer aided selection  c  importance of materials for sustainability  and d  material data and knowledge sources and their usefulness  at the end of the course  the students will learn to implement constructions designs based on appropriate and sustainable material selection from a variety of choices available to them
