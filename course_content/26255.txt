molecular dynamics simulation techniques  probability distributions  integration schemes  different thermodynamic ensembles  thermostats   analysis of computer simulation results  e g  pair distribution function  transport coefficients  time correlation functions  working with simple machine learning tools for protein optimization  to support the learning and understanding of the theory given in the lectures  there will be hands on exercises  where the participants will have the opportunity to modify existing programs and develop programs themselves lectures and exercises  computer lab lecture notesto provide the students with a basic introduction to molecular dynamics simulations used to model molecular systems and molecular interactions  this understanding will enable them to apply  evaluate and develop simulation programs for the solution of relevant problems in chemistry  chemical engineering  physics and biology  basic introduction to machine learning and its use in computational structural biology this course forms together with physical chemistry 3  26233  and advanced physical chemistry  26235  a natural unity  which provides the molecular basis for the thermodynamic description of equilibrium and non equilibrium systems  the course further provides a background for studies of chemical engineering  catalysis  surface chemistry  polymer chemistry  biological chemistry  and biochemistry   no exam in the regularly scheduled exam period
