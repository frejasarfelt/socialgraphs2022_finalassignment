initially  students learn about the innovation process and related tools  this is done through teaching and practical exercises  where processes and tools are applied to one or more specific  well defined cases   a coherent innovation process is then carried out in four phases  where the learned theory is applied in practice  the project is carried out in groups  group formation is structured based on students  profiles and competencies  apart from the work with the groups  own cases  they will also provide peer feedback to work of the other groups   as an introduction to the first phase  internal and external speakers from energy companies  industry and or athorities will present current problems related to the green  digital and interconnected energy system of the future  using the learned methods  various problems are examined with the objective to cover a wide range of needs  issues and possibilities  hypotheses and issues are investigated based on possible sources of information and internal external contacts   in the next phase  phase 2  a combination of ideas or directions identified during the research phase analyzes and synthesizes  this results in a problem description containing activities used to develop a new energy technology product or new energy technology service   phase 3 is the development phase  ideas are developed to solve the problem and the needs identified in the phase 2  structured design methods is used to develop the solutions   in phase 4  the innovation work is synthesized into a final concept  which ideally is tested on a relevant group of recipients  result is thus a product or service that solves the problem identified during phase 2   the product from the innovation process is reported by an oral presentation  finally  a self evaluation is prepared that reflects on the completed process and the methods and tools used   it may be possible to work further with the identified innovative energy solutions in a subsequent bachelor project  it is expected that the groups participate in gr√∏n dyst at dtu with the developed product  just as they can get help with entrepreneurship  if the group want to bring the idea to a start up lectures  workshops  group work on cases the overall course objective is to enable the students to design  implement and evaluate an innovation proces aimed at the green  digital and interconnected energy system of the future in collaboration with internal and external actors  the student is enabled to structure innovation processes  which together with the professional competencies within sustainable energy are applied to a selected case  the student is trained in identifying and analyzing problems  structuring the innovation process  working with sustainable energy solutions  disseminating results and ensuring value creation  among other things through ongoing interaction with various actors the first part of the course takes place in the 3 week period january  5 ects   the second part takes place in the first 4 weeks of the spring semester outside the regular module schedule  5 ects  limited number of seats  students at sustainable energy design have first priority  any available seats are allocated by lottery
