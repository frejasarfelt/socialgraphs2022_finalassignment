the course treats numerical methods for calculation of the following subjects    multidimensional and transient heat conduction in structures such as building components and fenestration systems with interfacial heat transmission in the form of solar radiation  thermal radiation  and convection    thermal processes in solar heating and other technical systems with liquid or gas flows in tubes  ducts and tanks  and with radiation heat transfer    mass flows such as moisture transport or air flow in building components under transient hygrothermal conditions  an important element of the course is the students  own construction of computational models based on numerical methods lectures and exercises  total work load equivalent to 140 hours   the course can be taken partly by distance learning  and in other periods than e3b  but requires attendance for at least five consultations with the course instructor to enable the participants to conceive some of the computational tasks occurring in building energy technology on temperature  heat flow  and moisture conditions with the aim to obtain solutions using numerical calculation methods  it is the objective to make the participants acquainted with common numerical calculation methods and to enable the development of associated computer programs  relevant topics of building energy technology comprise among other things the determination of temperature and moisture conditions  and heat flows in buildings and solar heating systems  solving of non linear problems will also be taught
