computer organization  introduction to computer organization and instruction sets  organization of the processor in a modern risc computer  control unit  data path  pipelining   the relationship between processor organization and instruction set  buses and i o units and between processor organization and operating systems  memory hierarchies  cache memories and virtual memory  new architectures which exploit different forms of parallelism   in parallel with the lectures students work on problems and  exercises and towards the end of the course students work on a final small project  the project can for example be to analyze and optimize the runtime of a given program by considering the processors pipeline structure and memory hierarchy using a simulator lectures  exercises and project to provide the participants with in depth knowledge on computer organization  and an associated understanding of issues which influence the run time of programs as well as an understanding of the interplay between hardware and software   today processors are used in all forms of electronic equipment and hence the course is relevant for software developers as well as  electrical  engineers designing embedded systems where it is often important to make efficient use of the resources of the processor in order to optimize performance  cost or energy consumption
