the lectures will cover the biological background for light interaction between light and soft matter  cells  cells in suspension  or tissue   photobiology and basic spectroscopic techniques  principles of bio imaging will be discussed  furthermore  lasers light sources will be covered  including basic principles of operation  various laser systems and their potential relevance for biophotonics  throughout the course practical examples and demonstrations will be used whenever possible lectures and exercisesthe interest for applications of coherent light and optical sensing in biology and medicine has been increasing the past years  this is partly due to the development of new laser systems  partly the development in advanced optical systems and advances non invasive diagnostics and analysis of biological and medical processes  the course covers the basics of the biochemistry of cells  basic light matter interactions  basic principles of light sources relevant for biophotonics  photobiology  and basic principles of bio imaging techniques lecturers from dtu fotonik  dtu health tech  dtu nanolab  and a number of invited external lectures from private industry    due to the interdisciplinary content of this course  a slight overlap to the courses 22512 34455 optical biosensors and 22511 34550 biomedical optics is inevitable
