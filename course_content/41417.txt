the course focuses on the application of modelling and simulation systematics to ensure the development of models that are conceptually  physically and mathematically consistent  the students will learn to develop models of different complexities i e  design  operational and transient models and will further learn to select the appropriate model complexity   the students will be introduced to the principles of different numerical solvers such as newton raphson and runge kutta and the practical applications of these  further  the students will gain practical experience in the use of simulation software suitable for simulating thermal energy technologies  an introduction will be given to engineering equation solver  ees   modelica and dynamic network analysis  dna  as well as fluid properties software such as coolprop or refprop   the students will work on a group project throughout the course where they will develop models of a thermal energy technology with increasing complexity  a design model will assess the influence of different cycle and component design variables  an operational model will assess the influence of off design operation and control strategies and finally  a transient model will assess the transient response and operation of the system  each of these models should be documented and analyzed in a technical report the course is taught as a flipped class room course where the theoretical background needed for completing the project work will be presented in a series of on line instructional videos  while course hours will be used for exercises  group work and peer feedback sessionsdigital solutions such as digital twins are expected to play a major role in the realization of the future energy sector i e  smart grids and smart cities as well as the industrial sector i e  industry 4 0  the backbone of such digitalization relies on the development of numerical models that are conceptually  physically and mathematically consistent and tailored to the specific objective of the application   the aim of the course is to give the students experience in developing numerical models of complex thermal energy technologies such as  heat pumps  organic rankine cycles  refrigeration systems  gas turbines and industrial process facilities  further  the students will learn to apply these models to simulate and analyze the technologies in question
