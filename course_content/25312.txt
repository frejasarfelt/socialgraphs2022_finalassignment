the course will be based on an overview and educate students in the developments in fisheries and ecosystem based management systems globally and in eu  as well as their conceptual methods  models and institutional set up  the course will give understanding of the complexity in fisheries management  decision making processes  and management options in context of multiple objectives and risks with respect to management of the sea  on this basis the course will give practical experience in use of different versions of advanced fisheries based and ecosystem based marine management evaluation models  as well as global understanding of the complexity in fisheries management systems  there will be made a general introduction to fisheries policies and their implementation  governance and institutional set up  this is followed by an introduction to r in context of models used in the course and methods for basic fisheries data modelling  simple and advanced methods and models will be used to assess fish stocks and fisheries  the side effects of fisheries  as well as to make fisheries management strategy evaluation  mse  and forecasts  the course will provide the student with basic quantitative and qualitative tools to estimate and evaluate fisheries impact on stocks and the marine ecosystem under different pre conditions by use of the models both in data rich and data poor conditions  this includes estimation of stock specific abundances and fishing mortalities as well as fisheries reference points associated with maximum sustainable yield  msy  from time series of catch and survey data using surplus production  spict  and age based  sam  models  also  the students will be educated in stakeholder perception of fisheries management and mse  in general  the course will give the student tools to evaluate stock based  ecological and fisheries bio economic effects of different types of and scenarios for management  i e  management options  strategies and management systems  before implementation under consideration of other ecosystem impacts  this also includes evaluation and understanding of economic and sociological consequences for different stakeholders and actors  finally  the course provides methods to evaluate and discuss ecosystem based management covering single and several stocks and fishing fleets in a cross disciplinary and cross sector perspective where the interactions between those are considered as well as the interactions with environmental and climate forcing factors lectures  group work  calculation and pc modeling exercises  home work with follow up on exercises  additionally  1 final assignment with a general descriptive part and a quantitative modeling exercise part  which is started at session 13 and submitted electronically in the weeks after in written report  power point  and relevant software form relevant primary literature scientific peer reviewed papers in pdf fomat fisheries management has global problems because the combined ecological  economic and sociological interactions and consequences of the fishery and the management are not considered  the scientific management advice is at present mainly based on evaluation of single stocks  eg  the overall biological and economic consequences of data poor non assessed stocks and mixed fisheries  i e  where several stocks of both target and unintended bycatch species are exploited in the same fishery  are not fully integrated into management  the effects of technological development and economic incentives and behavioral changes in the fishery are not taken into consideration  which impact the development of both stocks  fisheries  and the ecosystem  also  the ecological interactions are not integrated into the management advice  newly developed stock  fisheries and ecosystem based management models cover this complexity  this enables a more flexible and integrated scientific evaluation and advice with respect to development in stocks and fisheries and considers impacts from environment  fisheries  and management start conditions under different management systems  the course will make students familiar with selected quantitative stock based  ecosystem based and bio economic fisheries based management methods and evaluation models  which forms the basis for fisheries management advice and management strategy evaluation  the course gives students a basic understanding of the structure  dynamics  and function of the different management and fisheries systems from an ecological and socioeconomic perspective  it will provide tools to evaluate key stock  fisheries and ecological data  parameters  and indicators and to evaluate management scenarios before implementation with respect to their biological  bio economic  fleet  and sociological  behavior  impacts  sustainability  and risks  uncertainty  sensitivity    like a flight simulator this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs
