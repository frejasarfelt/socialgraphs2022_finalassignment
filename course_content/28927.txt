in order to design sustainable processes for the future  it is essential to use advanced process technologies  it requires a holistic and a systematic view on the process for a systematic identification of  novel  advanced process technologies to be used to match the individual challenges of the process  because of the potentially large range of topics that can be covered  a selection of topics will be considered each year  based on the background of the participants and the current state of the art  some examples of the topics are listed below  process technologies in biocatalysis  process unit operations integration  process intensification  design of sustainable processes or processes based on green engineering principles  scale translation  process analytical technology  evaluation tools based on sustainability  economic evaluation  life cycle assessment  lca   design of experiments  kinetics and reaction modeling  microfluidic application in biotechnology  computational fluid dynamics  cfd   spectroscopic methods for bioprocesses  etc  each topic will be analysed in terms of the generic problem to be addressed  the  available or desirable  solution strategy  methodological  model based  experimental  etc    necessary and desirable tools  advantages disadvantages  limitations  application  operating  window and testing of possible improvements about 40 hours are given for self study discussions lectures on selected topics of current interest in process technology  this is followed by 120 hours of applying evaluation testing the gained methods tools to different tasks exercises within the selected topics  based on these  for evaluation  a report is to be prepared  30h  as well as a seminar  30min  there are no textbooks for the course  for each student a collection of papers  maximum 10  published during the last 2 years will define the subject material and the background reading this course is aimed at introducing special topics from the current state of the art in process technology and engineering  the objective is to give the participants a quick  but thorough introduction to the latest developments in process technology from chemistry and biotechnology to engineering  which otherwise would not be possible due to lack of formal courses on such topics  at the same time  the course will help the participants in getting a broader view on tools for systematic understanding  designing  operating  analyzing and troubleshooting processes covering new process technologies
