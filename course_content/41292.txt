the course will consist of lectures by the instructors  a literature survey  independent study by the students  discussion sessions between instructors and students  and project work     at the beginning of the course  each student should have decided on a preferred topic within the area of marine hydrodynamics or related from the list provided by the course instructors     the project work focuses on the implementation of the chosen theory and numerical analysis model     the report should summarize the project work  supplemented by verification and validation of the implementation  as well as mathematical and or physical interpretation   the report can be in the format of a draft journal publication  or a more detailed scientific report lectures by instructors  self learning by students  discussion sessions  and project work to provide the student with knowledge of selected advanced topics analysis models within marine hydrodynamics related topics that are currently not covered by existing courses at dtu     to enable the student to understand  apply and implement the involved theory and numerical analysis l models before registering for the course  each student should contact the course responsible to get more details about the topic s  of interest   the following topics are currently offered   1  3d rankine panel method and implementation  solid and or porous structures    2  forward speed seakeeping problem  or called wave current structure interactions    3  second order wave loads and responses of moored structures  e g   mean  sum  and difference frequency loads  slow drift damping and responses  and mooring dynamics   4  analysis of available in service operational data   5  slamming  water entry and exit  and vibration  e g   wagner and von karman theories  generalized wagner and von karman  beam equations    6  sloshing and related resonant problems   e g   linear and nonlinear multimodal theory for sloshing  gap resonance  and other fluid resonances  and sloshing floater coupling     7  other numerical methods and marine hydrodynamics applications in the form of guest lectures  e g   finite difference method  harmonic polynomial cell method  finite element method  and spectral element method
