the course introduces the student to the connection between the structure and dynamics of materials and the associated scattering phenomena  which can be observed at international neutron and x ray facilities  such as ill and esrf in grenoble  france  ess and max iv in lund  as well as european xfel in hamburg  the student is introduced to key concepts such as cross sections  scattering factors  absorption  diffraction  small angle scattering  spectroscopy and fluorescence  after the successful completion of the course  the student will have acquired suitable prerequisite skills in the area of neutron and x ray research to be able to participate in academic or industrial research collaborations lectures  problem sessions andrew t  boothroyd  principles of neutron scattering from condensed matter  oxford university press  2020   j  als nielsen   d  f  mcmorrow  elements of modern x ray physics  john wiley   sons  ltd  2011  p  willmott  an introduction to synchrotron radiation  techniques and applications  second edition  john wiley   sons ltd  2019   doi 10 1002 9781119280453 and supplementary lecture notes on neutron and x ray scattering detailed understanding of the atomic scale structure and dynamics of materials is a crucial prerequisite for understanding their physical properties  and therefore also for the design of new materials of technological interest  examples include components of new drugs to combat diseases  superconductors and materials for solar energy harvesting and data storage  neutron and x ray scattering are complementary methods that allow investigations of structure and dynamics   the course introduces a series of experimental techniques in neutron and x ray scattering that allow the determination of all relevant structural parameters for molecules  amorphous systems and crystals  including the magnetic structure  furthermore  elementary excitations of the relevant structural  electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom  such as changing molecular bonds  phonons and spin waves  can be studied in great detail  either directly in the ultrafast time domain or via their spectroscopic signatures  x ray and neutron imaging creates 3 dimensional maps of the local structure within materials  hence  these techniques provide the means to uncover the fundamental mechanisms that govern the connections between structure and function for a wide range of materials and over a wide range of time and length scales    the overall goal of the course is to provide a broad understanding of modern x ray and neutron scattering  and a thorough introduction to the practical use of these techniques in the study of the structure and dynamics of materials  the importance of neutron and x ray scattering is underscored by the very large investments made by the danish state in the construction of the european spallation source  ess  and max iv in lund  sweden  and in the european xfel in hamburg  germany  the technical university of denmark is strongly involved in method development  design and construction of instruments  as well as scientific use of all three facilities
