quantum mechanical description of the physics and chemistry of clean surfaces  including the electronic and structural properties  description of electron structure of adsorbates of the surface  epitaxy  adsorption desorption mechanisms  chemisorption and the dynamics of chemical and physical reactions  description of the prerequisite for experimental studies of these surfaces under well defined conditions   this is ultra high vacuum  uhv  with base pressures below 10e 13 bar  the most popular methods  e g  x ray photoelectron spectroscopy  xps   auger electron spectroscopy  aes   ion scattering spectroscopy  iss   low energy electron diffraction  leed   electron microscopy  em  and scanning probe microscopy  afm and stm  will also be described  furthermore  fundamental aspects of heterogeneous catalysis especially in connection with the future energy production will be analysed  all the above mentioned methods will be discussed by use of a combination of lectures  exciting new research and application papers  and experiments followed by reports and oral presentations  a visit to the industry is also enclosed lectures  laboratory exercises and oral presentations book   concepts of modern catalysis and kinetics  by ib chorkendorff and hans niematverdriet  isbn  978352733268 7 obs 3rd edition   additional notes will be submitted as pdf files to give the students knowledge of the atomic scale physics prevailing at the interface between solid and gas liquid phases  this is of fundamental importance if you want to understand technologically important processes  e g  catalysis  adhesion  tribology  and mechanical and chemical properties of new nanomaterials  the course aims at giving the students an overview of the most applied methods and an introduction to how these can be used to study realistic problems within the surface physics area  the student will during the course independently perform experiments on advanced equipment  such that hands on experience with some of the methods is acquired  an important part of this course is the combination of experiments  report writing  and oral presentations in order to give the students experience with evaluating the individual methods for solving specific problems and to read the relevant literature
