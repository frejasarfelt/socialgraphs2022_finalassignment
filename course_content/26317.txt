virtually everybody in chemistry and biochemistry is working with various analytical methods that are applied to production  quality control and research  many important decisions in the society are executed on the basis of results of chemical analysis  examples comprise additives to food products  drinking water  waste water  quality of pharmaceuticals  nutrients and forensics  process control constitute another areas of research  where chemical analysis and biochemical analysis are important   a wide variety of technologies are treated at the course  such as sample preparation  spectrometric technologies and automatic technologies  a introduction is given to chromatography comprising gas chromatography  gc  and high performance liquid chromatography  hplc   the separation technologies are hyphenated with detectors  such as mass spectrometers  photo multipliers  diode array   electrodes and light scattering  measurements by other spectrometric methods and analysis by biosensors also has widespread application    inorganic chemistry   the subjects include ise  coulometry  stripping analysis  optical methods  turbidimetry  icp aes and icp ms   automatic methods   organic chemistry  methods for the separation and characterization of organic molecules including characterization of polymersthe course is primarily lectures and group work on the subjects from lectures   the examination is oral daniel c  harris  quantitative chemical analysis  10th ed the students obtain fundamental competences in chemical and biochemical analysis and the apparatus that is used for the analyses  furthermore gives insight into sample preparation   the course supply competences in technology of analysis  instrumental analysis  quality assurance  applied technology
