this course is built around a set of real world problems calling for polymer microsystem solutions  the solution to each problem will require both polymer fabrication and characterization techniques  many of them available as part of the dtu nanolab facilities  the course will include a short theoretical introduction to explain the basic principles behind the polymer microfabrication processes  the polymer micro  and nanofabrication methods discussed in the course include soft lithography  3d printing  from micro to macroscale   laser micromachining  hot embossing  and injection molding  furthermore  basic characterization methods such as optical microscopy  contact angle measurements  sem  profilometry and xps will be introduced  the content of the course is closely associated with the research projects at dtu nanolab that comprise practical use of polymer microtechnology autonomous experimental group work with an introduction to equipment and theory lecture notes and articles  chapters from  polymer processing  principles and design by donald g  baird and dimitris i  collias  2nd edition  2014  the goal of this course is to provide you with hands on experience in the experimental techniques used for polymer microfabrication and characterization  as well as to give you sufficient background to choose the most suitable techniques for a given application  you will be introduced to fast prototyping techniques such as laser ablation and 3d printing  and to mass fabrication methods such as injection molding  you will analyze a real world microsystems problem and propose a polymer prototype solution of your own design  you will learn to plan and carry out experiments in advanced laboratories  with focus on safe working procedures  you will also visit danish polymer processing companies to establish your network with relevant industry
