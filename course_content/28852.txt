the course consists of 3 parts  part one is concerned with the topic of land use planning including criteria for selection of a site for a new facility  evaluation of potential impact of incidents at the facility on neighbors and methods for the design of the facility layout to reduce the risk of undesired incidents  at the end of part one you will be able to select a site for a new facility using a number of qualitative criteria  and to develop a layout from a process description  as well as estimate impact on neighbors   part two is concerned with tools for hazard identification and risk assessment  such as hazid  hazop  eta  fta  qra and consequence analysis including source modeling  dispersion modeling  fire and explosion effect modeling  the use of these methods and tools are trained individually and in groups as appropriate  at the end of part two you will be able to participate in brainstorming meetings about hazards  construct simple event and fault trees  and quantify these  as well as perform a simple qra and consequence analysis   part three is concerned with the systems and training needed to be prepared for handling undesired incidents such that the consequences for the facility and surroundings are minimized  this will include discussion of management of safety critical operations  at the end of this part you will be able to specify elements for a safety management system  as well as plan and participate in a small table top emergency exercise lectures are given one afternoon a week  each lecture typically consists of two parts   a  about 2 hours of theory and exercise of the methods   and  b  2 hours of group work where the methods are applied and evaluated within the project assignment main textbook  chemical process safety fundamentals with applications  international edition by daniel a crowl and joseph f louvar  pearson education  2011   supplementary materials  1 process safety analysis  an introduction by bob skelton  icheme  1997   2  system reliability theory by marvin rausand  wiley  2nd edition   2004 to learn systematic methods and tools for questioning  identifying  analysing and managing safety and risk issues in industrial operations  these are useful for the preparation of a safety report as required by the seveso iii directive on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances  as found in pharmaceutical  biochemical  chemical and petrochemical industries the course deals with fundamental concepts and methods for risk assessment and process safety in chemical  and biochemical process industry  these methods help identify and quantify risks involved in process operations such that one can take appropriate measures to mitigate reduce the risks to practically acceptable level  the ultimate aim is safe operation and management of chemical and biochemical plants
