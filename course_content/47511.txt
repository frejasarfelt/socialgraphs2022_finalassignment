cinemax includes lectures and exercises covering the full pipeline from data acquisition through reconstruction and segmentation to modelling of real 3d imaging data basics of x ray tomography and imaging contrast modalities and length scales  tomography applications and 4d correlative tomography introduction to tomographic reconstruction  algebraic iterative methods and regularization  segmentation and meshing introduction to continuum mechanics and the finite element method introduction to flow modelling automatization tools visualization toolslectures  student presentations and hands on exercisescinemax is a summer school where you get the chance to get teaching and hands on experience with the complete workflow of high resolution tomography analysis  over 5 days  you will get introduced to data acquisition  3d reconstruction  segmentation and meshing and  finally  3d modelling of data to extract physical parameters describing mechanical and flow properties  the teaching and the exercises will take place in close interaction with top experts in the field  exercises will require some basic programming skills  and will be carried out in a common python environment  introduced through an e learning program that the students are required to follow before the school  introduction to advanced tomography on coursera https   www coursera org learn cinemaxe  the workload is 5 days of teaching   until 18 00 each day  with some exercise work in the evenings as well  after dinner  the first and last course days are Â½ course days  starting at lunch monday  ending at lunch friday  as part of the preparation of the summer school  we expect an additional workload of about 75 hours   1  following the coursera course  see general course objectives below  https   www coursera org learn cinemaxe   and  2  preparing a poster in advance of the phd summer course
