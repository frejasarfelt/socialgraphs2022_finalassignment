the course will cover an introduction to the different 1d and 2d homo  and heteronuclear nmr techniques with emphasis on what type of structural information the different nmr experiments yield  this will include a  description of the different nmr experiments  the analysis of different conformational and structural problems related to organic and biologically interesting compound classes will be covered lectures and problem session the aim of the course is to give an overview of the 1d and 2d nmr techniques that are being used in an nmr based structural analysis
