this 5 day course is primarily based on practical work  hands on  in combination with theoretical presentations  this year the course will focus on the comparison between diagnostic techniques for listed fish diseases by evaluating pros and cons of cell culture and real time pcr methods   at the first day of the course all participants will take part in a fish farm visit  the trip will be organized in collaboration with veterinary services and aquaculture association   protocols for inspection  necropsy and sample collection will be demonstrated  sample collection will involve mandatory sampling for testing listed disease  virology and molecular assay  as well as testing for differential diagnosis  bacteriology    starting from day 2  theoretical class room teaching will be given on methodologies  pitfalls and troubleshooting  after the introduction  the participants will be divided into groups  each group will start processing the samples collected at the farm  this process will include cell culture preparation  inoculation on monolayers  observation of cell culture and assessment of cytopathogenic effect  all cell cultures used for isolation of the listed viruses will be demonstrated and procedures will be conducted by the participants   participants will initially be introduced to basic cell culture work  24 well plate preparation for diagnostic purpose as well as 96 well plate for titration and flask maintenance will be demonstrated and subsequently prepared by the participants  inoculation of diagnostic samples on cell cultures will be practised  the cpe of different viruses will be shown and the participant will practise reading of diagnostic trays  titration procedures will be demonstrated and afterwards participants will have the opportunity to practise by themselves  finally  course participants will calculate virus titres  the application of accredited real time pcr protocols for surveillance will presented and discussed with the participants  furthemore  focus will be put on genetic characterization of listed fish viruses with theoretical lectures and practical exercises on sequencing  blast tool and phylogenetic analysis  for this reason each participant is required to bring his her own laptop  the concept of test specificity and sensitivity will be explained  and the students will learn how this affects validity of surveillance systems   the course is dialogue based and sufficient time will be given for discussions throughout the course and for the evaluation of test results  quality assurance  cleaning  disinfection  etc  will be an integral part of the practical demonstrations  the taught methods will primarily focus on the protocols given within the eu legislation and woah guidelines from the manual of aquatic animal diseases  and include how to select proper controls  the typical pitfalls and troubleshooting  etc  a social dinner will be organized on the second evening  further details are provided in the invitation letter during the course each participant is given an individual assignment  implementing protocols showed in the lab  small working groups receive a theoretical assignment to solve based on presentations given during the course  the course participants are expected to prepare for the course  having clear knowledge on fish diseases  virology and legislation regulating fish disease surveillance the course aims to provide the participants with knowledge on the most commonly used methods for diagnosis of important fish viral diseases  the course will focus on  1  basic cell cultivation techniques  production of cells for different purposes  ifat  diagnostic trays  titration  etc    cell susceptibility testing  inoculation of samples and sub cultivation procedures  reading of cell cultures  including cpe  and virus titration  2  providing the participants with knowledge on the most commonly used methods for diagnosis of important fish pathogens  3  real time pcr protocols validated for surveillance of listed fish diseases  4  genotyping the most important viral pathogens by sequencing and blasting  5  information on the underlying principles of the tests and how to critically review them in order to assess pitfalls  and 6  epidemiological aspects to consider when designing surveillance for viral diseases in fish aquaculture    the major focus will be on the viral fish diseases using vhs as model  the course will provide a forum where pre knowledge  experience and examples can be discussed between participants and teachers  and hereby raise the awareness of pitfalls when using the various techniques
