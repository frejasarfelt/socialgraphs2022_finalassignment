the course base is the synthesis of the plant and its derived operational goals which illustrate that process design and operation are two sides of the same fundamental problem  selection of actuators and measurements for a basic control structure at the single variable layer is introduced from a systematic model analysis  in a subsequent synthesis step a pairing of actuators and measurements is selected  how the operational goals may be achieved in practice through control is illustrated for selected examples  these examples will also demonstrate characteristic control structures lectures    simulation exercises and project work typical chemical plants may contain hundreds of measurements and control loops  most control theories  those you have seen in the introduction to process control  assume that a control structure is already given at the start  which reduces the problem to tuning and calculation of a control law  in practice  however  given a plant design with its process flow diagram  a control engineer faces the following problems  i  which variables should be controlled  ii  which variables should be measured  iii  which inputs should be manipulated  and iv  which links should be established between them  these are the questions that the plantwide control course addresses  to this end  a systematic methodology based on hierarchical decomposition of the control problem into layers is used for designing a plantwide control structure based on process understanding  the performance of the control structure is then evaluated and further refined using dynamic simulations of the process in question in an iterative manner    the goal of the course is thus to learn i  to manage the complicated task of designing a control strategy for the entire plant  ii  to understand process dynamics using dynamic simulations  iii  to develop and implement a control strategy that meets control design objectives  stabilize the system  optimize the economics  environmental sustainability and satisfy the constraints   and vi  evaluation of alternative solutions  ultimately all these efforts are to  help develop and operate better  safer   and optimal processes for chemical and biochemical industries the project includes derivation of a plantwide control strategy using a systematic approach and its evaluation using dynamic simulations  the plant in question is a typical processing unit in the kemical industry  a project report is prepared critically discussing and evaluating the performance of the plant wide control strategy
