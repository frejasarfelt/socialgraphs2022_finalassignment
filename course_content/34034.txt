laser beams  laser resonators  photonics  photons and atoms  laser amplifiers  laser oscillators  semiconductor optics and detectors lectures  demonstrations  group work  additionally exercises and computer simulations  these exercises include delivery of mandatory rapports in order to pass the course the course aims towards an introduction to the fundamental properties of lasers and optical detectors  the student must be able to explain the physical principles behind laser action and to describe a number of actual laser systems  he she will be able to solve simple problems in relation to the properties of light in optical resonators  coherent light and the interaction between light and matter  different types of laser systems will be considered including solid state  fiber and semiconductor lasers  the mode of operation and applications of a number of lasers is described so that the student will be able to understand and use commercial laser systems in connection with an actual problem  the students will be introduced to the characteristics and noise properties of optical detectors  finally  examples of optical based measurement techniques will be introduced  in addition to the lectures a number of experimental exercises are given
