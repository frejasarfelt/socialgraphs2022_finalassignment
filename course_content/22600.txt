in the course the physics  chemistry  and technology of the fabrication processes used is described   lithography  uv microlithography  e beam nanolithography  and nano imprint  pattern transfer  etching  lift off  thin film processes  cvd  pvd  spin on  substrate materials  silicon and silica  material modification  ion implant and doping diffusion  annealing  bonding  anodic bonding  fusion bonding  process integration  process simulation you will learn to use a modern process simulator  athena   http   www silvaco com   which will allow you to perform advanced computation   in the final part of the course you work in teams on making a process flow for a device that the team can freely choose and present lectures  e learning and exercises  4 hours a week  during the semester there are three home assignments  in the final part of the course there is a project which is presented at a scientific mini conference and finally there is a written exam devices and sub systems fabricated using nano  and micro fabrication techniques are used in an increasing number of modern products ranging from airbag sensors for cars to the processor in computers  the functionality of these products is critically dependent on the micro  and nano devices   the overall aim of the course is to enable you to select relevant processes and to design a fabrication process for silicon based micro and nanofabrication using the methods available in for example the dtu cleanroom danchip and in commercial cleanrooms for physics   nanotechnology students  the course can be taken on the 3  or 5  semester
