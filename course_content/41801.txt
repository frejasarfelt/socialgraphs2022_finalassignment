the topics in the course will depend on the selected project  but it is an essential part in the course to train project work  team work  in larger groups  this is obtained by controlling the process of forming the groups  starting the groups by requiring a contract on their cooperation and having a special initiation of the project  projects with a cdio  conceive  design  implement and operate  character are emphasized the lectures in project management and project work  the project runs both in the 13 week period  february may   where there is ample time for reflections under way  and in the following 3 weeks period  june   where it is possible to conduct whole day exercises and experiments the goal of the course is that the students     apply parts of the theoretical contents from the technology core courses from the bachelor program in mechanical engineering   try to solve a both practical and theoretical exercise in a team and get acquainted with project work in larger groups  typically five members    obtain some experience in solving a practical construction exercise followed by a presentation of the solution and an associated written documentation  a report  over both the solution but also the solution process itself compulsary course on the bachelor in mechanical engineeringthe project groups will be formed at the second lecture by the teacher using input from students
