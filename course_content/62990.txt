the course is about applying innovation theory and models in practice and solving concrete engineering innovation challenges in collaboration with a company  the course works systematically with innovation as an exploratory process aimed at building up knowledge as a basis for seeing new opportunities  important parts of this work is to thoroughly investigate the problem and its context and see the problem from different perspectives  reframing   another important element is to develop value creating solutions that take into account the context in which the solution should be implemented  visits and interviews with key stakeholders are an important part of the work and activities out of the house must therefore be expected   through the work on the concrete innovation challenges  experience with navigating constructively in a complex engineering reality is gained and with putting on a business perspective on both problem understanding and problem solving  considerations about users  technology  design  sustainability  market  society and economics must be involved in both problem understanding and problem solving  as key elements of an innovation process  work will be done in these areas  problem identification  idea generation  collection and assessment of quantitative and qualitative information  prototyping  and testing and testing of ideas  prototypes and concepts   the course provides training in delivering a concise  inspiring and informative presentation  pitch  of selected solutions as well as guidance on how the written reports are targeted to recipients and intentions  the teaching method is based on blended learning  where a significant part of the theoretical teaching takes place as e learning and the course days are organized as a mix of workshops  group work and corporate meetings  later in the process there will also be work in the workshops in skylab and at the ballerup campus  the project groups are composed of engineering disciplines  and two business cases are conducted during the course  teamwork and project work are essential parts of the course and the course s learning process  students are therefore expected to take an active and constructive role in the organization of the team s project work   throughout the course  groups and students individually lead a logbook that continuously describes and reflects on the course activities and how they are handled in the groups and for the individual  this logbook provides the grounds for creating a detailed understanding of content and learning at the end of the course   practical information    group formation takes place at the first day of the course  if you are unable to attend  please contact the course manager    the course language is english and all assignments must be formulated in english the course is based on interdisciplinary team work on a company project   interdisciplinary team work requires that you work together  consequently  an active attendance is expected to pass the course   teaching takes place as a combination of e learning and workshops book    delft design guide  by annemiek van boeijen  jaap daalhuizen  jelle zijlstra  roos

solve complex challenges in companies through using your engineering knowledge and thereby train an innovative mindset    in the course  you will learn how to organize and implement a multidisciplinary innovation process using relevant innovation models and methods as well as technological knowledge    give you a basic understanding of activities and processes in an innovation process and work on how innovation models and methods are applied and adapted to an innovation challenge in practice  the goal is also to connect business understanding and value creation with the innovation process as well as solving this kind of challenges in a manner of an engineering professional    train the understanding and analysis of a problem and its context  and relate it to a business  organizational  technological and user perspective and  on this basis  formulate a number of possible solutions    train communication of problem awareness  needs and solutions to relevant stakeholders through  pitch  prototypes and written presentation    provide insight and experience in working and collaborating across engineering disciplines as part of your engineering professionalism mandatory course for all bachelor of engineering students on the 5th and 6th semesters  course duration is 6 weeks  nb   please note  the course is scheduled outside the dtu scheme for july and august  exact dates will be announced her in the event of a draw  students enrolled in the b eng  program in arctic civil engineering and students with more than 150 ects point have priority
