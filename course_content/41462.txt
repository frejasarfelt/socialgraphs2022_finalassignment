building simulations tools are an integral part of design processes for modern buildings  they are used to estimate the performance of building envelope  heating and ventilation systems  and other relevant components and services  the present course focuses on applying dynamic building simulations to evaluate heating  cooling  and ventilation systems  the course gives an overview of possibilities and limitations related to dynamic simulations  provides information about different complexity levels in which the heating  cooling  and ventilation systems can be simulated and introduces the principles of evaluating their performance  we focus on the system functionality in the building context and analyze the relationships between the features of the building and their influence on the systems  performance  a particular focus is on analyzing and interpreting results  which play a crucial role when decisions are to be taken in real projects lectures  exercises and group workthe course teaches the participants to work with dynamic building performance simulation tools with focus on heating  cooling and ventilation systems  the course does not focus on basic principles related to functionality of heating  cooling and ventilation  but rather on a holistic approach to their performance and the consequences it has for buildings and indoor environment  the participants learn to analyze simulation results and optimize system performance in the context of sustainable buildings  during such process  they need to account for predefined performance requirements regarding indoor environment and energy consumption the course relies on students bringing their own pc  the programmes used in the course requires a windows based pc  students using mac computers can use boot camp to install a windows partition on their computer  students at dtu can for free download and install windows via microsoft dreamspark  for more information follow the link https   www campusnet dtu dk cnnet software  you need a dtu login to open the link
