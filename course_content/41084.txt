the course basically aims at giving the participants knowledge of how biology can be used activily in technical development  a basic understanding of biologically inspired deisgn as a development method is established including possibilities and challenges in designing with inspiration in nature  the course include an introduction to bid and a 3 phase project   1  search  search in biological literature and a literature study for a selected functional area  2  interpretation  identification of relevant biological analogies and principles and translation into technical solution principles  3  design  sketching  development and validation of new solutions  examples of functional areas could be    food storage  need for new conservation techniques   e g  the spiders sedation of prey  mice food stock       silent aerodynamics  need for silent windmills  ventilators       e g  the silent flight of owls      night vision  need for orientation in the dark   e g  insect vision  kats vision  owls hearing  sharks stereo smell sensation  bat sonar       navigation  need for geographic orientation  e g  manure beetles and polarisation  migrating birds and butterflies       cleaning  need for not getting dirty   e g  hydrophobic surfaces at lotus plants  dirt and water repellant bird feathers     combination of lectures  exercises  exciursion and project workthe objective is to gather insight and experience in applying the method biologically inspired design  bid    which also includes the topics biomimetics  biomimicry and bionics  bid is used to search nature for relevant analogical solutions and apply the findings actively as inspiration when developing and designing products a collaboration has been established with the course lfkk10412u innovation   inspired by nature at copenhagen university  ku   ku students can participate in the dtu course and contribute with their biological science background in the project groups  there will also be supervision from biologists from copenhagen university
