after completing this course  you can use deep learning to analyze 3d volumetric images  to do this  you have gained knowledge of relevant deep learning analysis methods  how you deploy these methods on a computer  and how you prepare data for deep learning  data is core to deep learning based 3d image analysis  and you gain experience with annotation tools necessary for preparing training data for segmentation  in addition  the course includes experimental elements  so you learn how to prepare samples to be scanned and are introduced to 3d imaging and ct reconstruction  you will use python for implementing scripts to solve analysis tasks based on existing deep learning libraries and functions  finally  you will learn to evaluate model performance  partly through the validation and test data and partly through visual inspection of the obtained analysis result lectures followed by exercises course notes you will get practical experience in using deep learning to analyze 3d images  the main focus is on image segmentation  but you will also learn about other methods such as image classification and detection  3d imaging is used in medicine  biology  materials research  etc  to analyze a material s internal structure including its shape  size  number of features  etc if you want to analyze complex 3d images using deep learning  this course is for you  you will also learn how to record 3d images using x ray Âµct scanners  in parallel to this course  there is the new course  02509 high performance computing for analysis of experimental 3d imaging data   which introduces other image analysis techniques and more hands on imaging  you are also recommended to follow that course
