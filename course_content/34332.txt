project tasks with design of circuits for communication systems  such as package parsing  bug detection  hash features  cryptographic blocks for coding  high speed serial links  package processing and memory management  scrambling and frame management   coding preferably in vhdl for synthesis in the fpga   optimization of code  timing  area  in order to meet defined design criteria lectures  exercises  and projects to develop fpga based digital hardware design for use in communication systems and thereby use modern development tools for design  synthesis  simulation and testing  the course is aimed at students who want to take a more project oriented approach to acquired skills in course 34311 or equivalent  examples of tasks in clude checksum calculation  frame management  switching  routing  etc  projects are carried out mainly based on the intel quartus tools including modelsim
