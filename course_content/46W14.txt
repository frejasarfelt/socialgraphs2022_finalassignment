this course is problem driven  with emphasis on iterative  active learning  primarily through addressing and solving specific problems involved in wind resource assessment  from theory to practice  but also by applying the acquired understanding and critical thinking to answer open ended questions based on practical issues of industrial relevance    the course covers  relevant meteorology  motions and force balances from meso  to planetary scale and important thermodynamic effects   basic atmospheric boundary layer structure and flow phenomena  micro  and meso scale modeling and practices  including basic parameterizations and numerical aspects  analysis and use of wind statistics from measurements and models  incl  e g  wind atlas data   and  scrutiny of both inputs to and outputs from wind resource modeling  the students are encounter several  3  mandatory assignments in the course  the information and computational framework required to do the assignments will be provided through short modules consisting of video presentations  notes  book excerpts  quizzes and live  question answer  sessions e learningto provide the student with the necessary understanding of the atmosphere and knowledge of tools to perform wind energy resource assessment at various scales
