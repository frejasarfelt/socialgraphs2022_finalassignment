advanced understanding in biosynthesis of complex natural products  such as polyketides  bioactive ribosomal and non ribosomal peptides  terpenoids and compounds of mixed biosynthetic origin  use of bioinformatic tools such as antismash  blast  and other tools for annotation of genes  gene clusters  and prediction of the nature of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of natural products  importantly  this course is directed towards both biotech students  as well as students interested in organic chemistry  who want to strengthen their biochemical knowledge lectures  exercises  literature search  group work and student presentationsthe overall aim of the course is to give the students a comprehensive overview of  i  the different types of complex small organic molecules  secondary metabolites   natural products  that microorganisms  algae and plants can biosynthesize  ii  the different types of unique enzymes that catalyzes their biosynthesis  iii  the nature of the underlying gene clusters  and iv  how bioinformatics tools can be used to link genes to chemical structures and vice versa
