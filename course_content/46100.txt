the course is an introduction to the atmospheric physics and associated basic statistical analysis relevant to wind energy  it deals with the atmospheric boundary layer  including stability  roughness and topography  mean winds and extreme wind statistics  it also involves turbulence and gusts  description of these includes spectra  coherence and probability density functions  sources of wind data are reviewed  and wind resources are treated  the course material is primarily notes  pdf file   with interactive lecture at the chalkboard also involving some in class exercises and including some slides   the course is assignment driven  numerical programming  e g  python  matlab  mathematica  is needed to conduct the assignments lectures with discussion and in class exercises  mandatory computational assignments drive the assessment and hands on learning notes are provided to give a general and usable understanding of atmospheric flow physics and statistics relevant for wind energy  including turbulence and wind resources
