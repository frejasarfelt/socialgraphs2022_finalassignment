environment capture using lidar  slam  photogrammetry  object acquisition using time of flight and structured light  capturing material appearance using photography  shaders for photo realistic rendering  interaction methods in xr using controllers  accelerometers  touch  headsets for xr  technologies for ar with handheld devices  unity3d or similar tools for vr experiences lectures  exercises  and project workin this course  students will learn how to model experiences for virtual reality  augmented reality  mixed reality  etc  collectively xr   initially  students are introduced to methods and technologies for acquisition of geometry  material appearance  and illumination  this is followed by a series of lectures on technologies for xr and content modelling methods  starting from roughly the middle of the semester  students do their own modeling for an xr experience in a project which stretches over the last half of the semester  the results should be described in a report which is handed in at the end of the semester
