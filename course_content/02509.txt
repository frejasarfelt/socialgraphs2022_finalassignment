you will learn the core skills necessary for using 3d imaging including setting up scans  writing code  using software tools  and experimenting with data    during the hands on experiments with 3d imaging  you will learn how to prepare and mount samples for 3d scanning and set the scanner parameters  you will also learn methods for reconstructing and analyzing the acquired images  this includes visualization methods  image processing  and analysis techniques such as filtering  image morphology  and segmentation  and you will learn to compute statistics of the shape and size of imaged structures   3d images are often very large  and a single image can be several gb  making data handling and processing challenging on a normal pc  therefore  you will learn to use high performance computing systems that enable the processing of large amounts of data using the g databar as a shared platform where both cpu and gpu processing units are available  you will also learn analysis strategies that will ensure efficient image analysis  where algorithms are first tested on small volumes and later scaled up   through the course  you will gain the basis for working with 3d imaging as a tool  and you will gain prerequisites for working further within 3d imaging  image analysis  and or high performance computing lectures followed by exercises course notes in this course  you will work with 3d µct imaging and analysis of 3d images  3d imaging is particularly useful if you want to investigate the internal structure of a material on a microscopic level without destroying the sample you are imaging  you can use this in a wide range of areas from medicine to materials research  to use 3d imaging you need to combine knowledge from three areas  image acquisition  image analysis  and knowledge of the sample you are studying   in this course  you will get the skills that will enable you to use 3d imaging as a research tool  you will work with experimental imaging using 3d μct from laboratory scanners and we plan a beam time visit to the max iv synchrotron in lund  max iv is a new world class research facility that offers unique opportunities within 3d imaging   the most difficult  but also fun and rewarding part of 3d imaging  is analyzing the images  in this course  you will get the practical skills to carry out advanced visualization and analysis  and you do not need to have worked with image analysis before  throughout the course  you will use high performance computing when analyzing large 3d images if you want to carry out 3d imaging and analyze the acquired images using advanced visualization and analysis methods  this course is for you   in parallel to this course  with a focus on image analysis  high performance computing  and experiments   there is another new course  02508 deep learning for experimental 3d image analysis   which will give you skills to analyze large 3d images using deep learning  it is possible  and advantageous  to follow both courses
