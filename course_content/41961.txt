introduction to the fundamental theoretical basis for the formulation of geometrical non linear and dynamic behaviour  as well as optimization of collaps load  and description of the corresponding fem formulation  presentation of classic solution strategies and their numerical implementation  the course is structured around lectures and exercises covering both analytical approach  further development of supplied matlab code  independent matlab programming and the use of a commercial program lectures and exercisesthe scope is to introduce finite element models for non linear fem problems within structural mechanics  including geometric non linearity  dynamic behaviour and ideal plastic optimization of collaps load
