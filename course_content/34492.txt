the content of this course is similar to the content of the course 34052 nonlinear optics  more specifically the first 2 3 of the course will run in parallel whereas in the last 1 3 of the course the ph d  student will be asked to provide a 45 minutes long lecture on a topic that the ph d  student will be told at least 4 weeks before the lecture shall be given  the lecture covers fundamental material related to nonlinear optics and should be given to the other students attending the course 34052 nonlinear optics  in this last 1 3 of this ph d  course the student will also solve a larger assignment as described in course 34052 nonlinear optics lectures and theoretical exercises incl  poster presentations and preparation and presentation of a lecture k  rottwitt  p tidemand lichtenberg   nonlinear optics  principles and applications  crc press  isbn 9781466565821at the end of the course the participants should be able to perform simple evaluations of nonlinear phenomena in optics  examples will be directed toward applications within optical communications  sensors and lasers  in addition  this ph d  course also aims at training the ph d  student in providing a 45 minutes long lecture on a topic covering fundamental material related to nonlinear optics fellow teachers     peter tidemand lichtenberg  campus ris√∏  bygning 108  ptli fotonik dtu dk  phone   46 77 45 79
