the course treats instrumentation systems and selected sensors such as thermistors  strain gauges and sensors based on inductive  capacitive and piezoelectrical effects  electronic principles used to convert sensor signals to more convenient analogue signals are also treated    the laboratory exercises give the student practical experience with applying different sensors and electronic components compulsory laboratory exercises notes and exercise guides and j  fraden  handbook of modern sensors 5  ed  or earlier  to give a basic foundation in essential methods used in electronic measurements of physical quantities  laboratory exercises will give the student experience with a number of principles used to convert a physical parameter into an electrical signal and the first analogue processing of the often noisy signal
