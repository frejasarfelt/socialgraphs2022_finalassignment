in the course you will learn about the structural chemical  mechanical  electronic  photonic properties  and fabrication and applications  primarily of graphene  but also other two dimensional materials  such as boron nitride and molybdenum disulfide  with combined theoretical  practical and communicative activities the course seeks to enable you to participate in a research project or collaboration on graphene research at a high level  irrespective of whether you are oriented towards theoretical or practical problems in your msc phd thesis the course is comprised of thematic modules  structure  fabrication  electronic and optical properties and applications  ordered to give the best possible pedagogical and logical flow  the teaching is a dynamic mix of lectures  critical reading of articles  invited speakers  discussions  analysis of articles and data  computer as well as manual calculations  40  of the teaching is in form of group work the course is based on notes  scientific articles  slides from lectures  and chapters from books and theses   as well as on your critical study of these diverse sources the goal of the course is to  1  give you a good understanding of the most important and often quite unique properties of graphene and other 2d materials   2  an overview of current graphene research as well as the ability to view it in critical light  as well as  3  sufficent knowledge to be able to write a detailed  technical research application  describing and arguing for an idea  in addition accounting for how it may be carried out in practice   4  understanding of the practical application of 2d materials
