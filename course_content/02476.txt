proper coding environments  code organisation  good coding practises  code and data version control  reproducible and containerized environments  reproducible experiment management  debugging tools  code profiling  large scale collaborative experiment logging and monitoring  unit testing  continuous integration  continuous machine learning  cloud infrastructure  cloud based machine learning training  distributed data loading and training  local and cloud based deployment  monitoring of deployed applications the course includes lectures  exercises and project work  the lectures are short and provide context why each topic is important  the main focus is on exercises with emphasis on practical tools and coding skills for machine learning in production  finally  approximately 30  of the course is spent on project work in groups of 3 5 persons  where tools throughout the course should be applied on a self chosen machine learning problem introduce the student to a number of coding practices that will help them organization  scale  monitor and deploy machine learning models either in a research or production setting  to provide hands on experience with a number of frameworks  both local and in the cloud  for doing large scale machine learning models
