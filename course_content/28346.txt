students will plan and perform an  open ended  practical fermentation process exercise in groups  based on considerate calculations on generated data combined with data found in scientific literature the students will evaluate and conclude on the performance of the fermentation process tested and discuss possible process optimization strategies  the course will also deal specifically with monitoring techniques and challenges in scaling up of bioprocesses  the course will be focused on selected processes  which may include e g  production of biofuels  biogas  baker s yeast  enzymes and antibiotics  both processes based on pure production cultures and processes based on microbial consortia may be considered  the group work will be summarized in a written report  which forms the basis for the oral examination 3 weeks period with practical and theoretical group workto provide the students hands on experience with pilot scale microbial cultivations and with a more profound and advanced perspective on industrial fermentation applications
