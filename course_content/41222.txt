starting from the basic conservation laws for a fluid flow  the navier stokes equations  we derive the potential flow approximation for the hydrodynamic interaction between a fixed or floating marine structure and ocean waves   this problem is linearized  assuming small amplitude waves and small body motions  to express the structure as a linear harmonic oscillator   the relationship between the time  and frequency domain expressions is stressed   green s theorem is used to derive a number of useful relations between coefficients  as well as high  and low frequency limits   green s theorem also leads to the boundary integral form of the problem and further to the boundary element method  bem  which is the most widely used numerical solution technique for obtaining the hydrodynamic coefficients   a number of variants of the bem are discussed including both 2d strip type methods and 3d methods based on either the free surface or the rankine green function   as exercises  the student will develop their own 2d  bem solver is both for infinite fluid problems and for wave radiation and diffraction  finite difference and finite volume solutions are also discussed   weekly exercises are solved to illustrate the theory   a solver for the equations of motion is built in matlab and applied to analyse several typical structures   several short concept tests will also be given during the course of the semester lectures  exercises  short concept tests  and a final oral exam  marine hydrodynamics   40th anniversary edition  by j n  newman  mit press 2017  lecture notes after completing this course  the student should be able to use linear potential flow theory to predict the wave induced motions of floating maritime structures   an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different numerical solution techniques will allow the student to make the appropriate choice depending on the application   the primary focus  for example applications  is on ships  offshore wind turbines and wave power devices
