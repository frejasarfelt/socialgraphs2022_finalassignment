in this course the fundamental hydrodynamics and wave dynamics obtained as part of course 41111 will be applied  the students will recieve an introduction to the most relevant modules in the dhi mike software package such as the hydrodynamic  hd   spectral wave  sw   sand transport  st  and mud transport  mt   during the last half of the course the students will work in groups to establish their own complex models to solve a realistic engineering problem  such problems could be  i  flow and wave simulations to provide design conditions for a potential offshore wind mill farm  ii  dispersion of contaminants in a coastal environment and  iii  sediment transport and coastline evolution around a harbour lectures and group work in smaller groups  at the end of the course the students will make an oral presentation of their work to introduce students to the use of numerical methods in hydraulics  in this course the solution to various coastal and offshore engineering problems will be obtained by using a commercial numerical modelling software  mike 21 of dhi   the course will focus on typical applications encountered in marine and coastal environments
