managing carbon dioxide emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels is a major concern for the development of a sustainable energy system in the future  it is a transdisciplinary challenge involving engineering  physical and social science as well as policy and legal issues  carbon capture  utilization and storage has been widely recognized as an important set of technologies for managing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere   this course will introduce existing as well as new technologies to capture carbon dioxide from point sources such as power plants or industrial processes  e g  cement and steel manufacturing   and ultimately the capture of carbon dioxide from ambient air  furthermore  the course will touch upon co2 negative concepts  e g  bio carbon capture storage   with respect to conversion of captured co2  this course will deal with different conversion technologies  ranging from electrolysis  e g  solid oxide cells  to algae  the pros and cons of the technologies  required co2 purity etc   as well as options for storage will be discussed  the course will also include utilization of co2 in p2x systems  converting co2 with electricity  additional chemicals and processes into e fuels and chemicals  e g  waxes and plastics   in addition to basic science and engineering challenges of the different carbon capture utilization technologies  economic  environmental  regulatory  and political policy aspects  and their implication for regional and global carbon management strategies of the future will be discussed  lastly  a field trip to the arc co2 capture facility at amager resource centre will be arranged as part of the course   the course is taught by leading experts with a great deal of experience in this field  and it aims to bridge the gap between the forefront of the latest developments in science  engineering  geology  policy and economics  and the wider public lectures  group work  exercises and field trip  the course will be evaluated during the course periodin the course we only use teaching material   textbooks  assignments  articles  etc    that is available via e g  www  dtu library  dtu inside this course will provide future engineers with a basic and broad knowledge of carbon capture  utilization and storage technologies which are emerging and rapidly growing in necessity for large scale co2 removal from the atmosphere  the students will  1  acquire an overview of the state of the art as well as new technologies to capture  transport  convert and store co2  2  develop an understanding of their physical and chemical principles  capabilities and limitations  materials employed  system designs  and techno economics   furthermore  the students are expected to analyze the comparative advantages and applications of the technologies and to design select systems for chosen scenarios  the main focus is on the natural science aspects with a smaller part relating to techno economic aspects you will gain a basic understanding of the principles  comparative advantages  and techno economics of carbon capture  utilization and storage technologies  and you will learn how these emerging technologies can contribute to mitigate climate change
