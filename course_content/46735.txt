the focus of the course will be on design operation of components and subsystems of wind and solar generation as well as the battery storage technology    this could include drivetrains and the drivetrain topologies that are used in modern multi mw wind turbines  i e  geared  medium speed and direct drive permanent magnet generators with full converters  induction generators with full converters  and doubly fed induction generators  dfig   as well as pv string with grid connected dc ac converter and control  as well as modeling and design and operation of battery energy storage used in renewable energy systems  battery modeling  dc dc converter typologies        students will apply their engineering skills and knowledge through a design assignment in one of the focused area of the subsystem design  the project will be carried out using both simulation platforms  simulink matlab  labview and comsol  and laboratory setups and will be base for a final report  students will need to present and defend lectures  simulations  experiments and practical implementation in the laboratory the objectives of the course are to enable students to learn about various concepts of electrical drivetrains in a wind turbines  pv installations and energy storage technology   some of the aspects of the drivetrain design addressed in the course  include principle of operation  choice  designing and sizing of generators  power electronic converters  ac dc and dc dc   transformers and passive components  as well as designing control schemes that tie components together in associated systems  wind turbine  pv system  electrical storage system     after dedicated lectures and assignments where we will work on concepts and designs sizing of major components for each drivetrain concepts  students will have the opportunity to specialize in a design and or operation of one of the major components of drivetrain based on their preferences  eg  wt generator design and operation and speed control  pv and storage dc dc converter operation   implementation of pv mppt control schema etc      the further course objective is to enable students to experimentally implement one of their specializations in a laboratory experimental  setup e learning is used in the form of chat room  learn
