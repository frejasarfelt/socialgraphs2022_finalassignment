this course provides an introductory view of fish physiology and of the physiological challenges to which fish are exposed in typical aquaculture facilities  along with the solutions adopted in the aquaculture industry to overcome those challenges  the course covers topics such as functional anatomy of fish  nervous system and sensory systems  ion and gas exchange and homeostasis  nutrition  immune system and pathological states  reproduction  stress physiology  welfare in aquaculture  nociception and analgesia  fish behavior and cognition  the constraints on all those aspects of fish physiology derived from the life in captivity  as well as the ways to mitigate them  are discussed lectures  case discussions  mini seminars a compendium will be proposed at the beginning of the course to provide the students with knowledge of fish biology that is relevant to and applicable within the field of aquaculture  the overall aim of the course is to provide students with a fundamental understanding of the many physiological and biochemical processes that occur in fish  so that they may use this knowledge in the evaluation and management of biological issues that arise in aquaculture production this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  12  responsible consumption and production  and  14  life below water
