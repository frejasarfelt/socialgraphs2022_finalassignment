the course covers three main topics    1  the compilation process  from high level programming language to hardware architectures and virtual machines   2  intermediate representations and their role in compilers  and  3  lexing  parsing  code analysis  code generation  and optimizations  the course project requires to extend an existing compiler framework to support more advanced programming language features lectures  theoretical exercises  and practical exercises compilers contribute to the reliability of software systems by analyzing and optimizing the system s code  and by guaranteeing properties of the generated executables  many it companies  including e g  google  facebook  and microsoft  create and maintain compilers for new and existing programming languages   this course teaches techniques to efficiently implement modern programming languages  and to guarantee reliability of the generated executables  we cover essential techniques in modern compilers  from implementation of high level concepts over optimizations to run time support for new hardware architectures  during the course  students will work in groups on a compiler for a realistic programming language
