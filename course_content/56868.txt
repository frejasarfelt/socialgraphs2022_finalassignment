the course has a theoretical part  a methods part and an applied part  in the theoretical part  the physics  chemistry  and technology of the fabrication processes used in modern micro  and nanofabrication is described  some of the subjects covered are  uv lithography  reactive ion etch  rie   lift off  chemical vapor deposition  cvd   plasma enhanced cvd  physical vapor deposition  pvd   silicon and silica as substrate materials  material modification by ion implant and doping diffusion  annealing  bonding  anodic bonding  fusion bonding  process integration  process simulation  and characterization  the methods part consists of 5 tpts  tool package trainings  containing hands on instructions  1  cleanroom safety 2  lithography 3  mask design 4  scanning electron microscopy  sem  5  plasma etching  in the applied part of the course  the students will a  follow a guided experimental part focusing on the fabrication of a pressure sensor in the dtu nanolab cleanroom or b  acquire specialized knowledge in a selected topic of advanced micro  or nanofabrication  in both cases  the results will be presented to the other participants at the end of the course hands on instructions  lectures  e learning  exercises  and project work course material will be available after course start the overall aim of the course is to provide you with theoretical background and hands on experience in the most common experimental techniques used for silicon microfabrication  you will be introduced to microfabrication methods such as photolithography  etching  thin film deposition and characterization techniques such as sem and profilometry  this should enable you to design a fabrication process  draw a lithographic mask and safely work in the dtu nanolab cleanroom previously  this course had the number 10868  the course is intended as introductory course for phd students who plan to perform cleanroom based si micro  and nanofabrication in their phd project and have no or limited previous experience in the dtu nanolab cleanroom   we recommend supervisors and students to contact a course responsible as early as possible to discuss the relevance of the course for the phd student
