at first  the technology and idea is introduced  then  the participants define different tasks for their project work   it could be development of a prefabricated beam  column  a connection detail  a bridge  a hall  an architectural expression of a building or calculation tools  new combinations of materials etc  the results are visualized and presentedproject work  lectures  tutorials etc course book  papers  reports  and student work on the subject plus common technical literaturesuper light structures and pearl chain reinforcement  sandwich arches and element cupolas are new concrete structures invented at dtu civil engineering   they open possibilities for new shapes of building structures and for reducing the price and resource consumption to less than the half of that of usual structures of concrete and steel  the course aims to give the participants competences to understand  design and calculate super light structures and participate in the development of their details  components and architectural expressions  you learn how to create an optimal and possible force distribution and to design a structure for it  instead of first designing a structure and then finding the forces in it  in addition  the course gives competence in establishing calculation models and identifying critical matters for a design  which is important for engineering work at the early phases of a building project the course is originally made for the m sc  in architectural engineering  but is usually taken by an equal number of students from the m sc  in civil engineering  students from the bachelor educations are also welcome if they fulfill the prerequisites  especially those concerning calculations related to concrete structures the course is a general competence course at the master in architectural engineering
