water quality measurements in small scale ras  short term laboratory experiments on water treatment processes  calculation exercises on data from larger experiments and commercial aquaculture  dimensioning of water treatment components  writing of reportscalculation exercises on experimental data and data from commercial aquaculture sites  practical work in groups in short term experiments  writing of reports  excursion to aquaculture facilities  together with 25316 the course is a practical add on course to course no  25316 recirculating aquaculture systems  as such  it is supposed to strengthen the students  understanding and ability to evaluate the operation and performance of water treatment processes  practical set ups and exercises are performed in small scale in the lab  data achieved from trials as well as data from commercial operations will be evaluated to provide the student with an understanding of water quality parameters and dimensions of commercial ras  the students will work in small groups and get hands on experience with basic water quality measurements and short term experiments related to recirculating aquaculture systems  the experimental work is supposed to encourage students to put their theoretical knowledge into practice  reflect on practical issues related to water quality measurements  and to understand research in recirculating aquaculture systems as an applied science the teaching in spring 2021 will be held on campusthis course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  2  zero hunger    12  responsible consumption and production  and  14  life below water
