computational fluid dynamics applied to chemical engineering problems  material transport limitions and mixing studes  heat transfer  adsorption and desorption phenomena as well as the implementation of basic chemical reactions in three dimensional geometries  transient and steady state simulations for single component  multicomponent  single phase and multiphase flow  porous material and rotating geometries  retention time distribution analysis  the course content helps to consider the sustainable production in relation to the exploitation of raw materials  reduction of waste products and the effectivity of reactor designs lectures and individual workthe aim of the course is to give the students hands on experience of a modern software tool for computational fluid dynamic simulations  ansys cfx   the software will be applied in chemical engineering case studies  which will include material transport limitations and mixing studies  heat transfer  adsorption and desorption phenomena as well as the implementation of basic chemical reactions in three dimensional geometries  the course will be based on the theoretic knowledge of course 28530 transport processes  which is strongly recommended as prerequisite course  the focus of the course will however be on the practical use of the software modules that are necessary to implement the fluid dynamic problem  this will include the sketching with help of solidworks  meshing  predefinition of the cases  the solving and finally the post processing of the results the teaching in january 2021 will be held on campus
