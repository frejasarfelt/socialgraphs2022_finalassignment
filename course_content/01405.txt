the course consists of lectures and exercise sessions  we start with introducing the mathematical model in the framework of linear algebra over finite fields  and we investigate the overall boundaries within it  gilbert varshamov bound and exponential time decoding  next important algebraic codes are introduced  reed solomon codes  where univariate polynomials are used as an algebraic tool  vi consider an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes and show how it can be implemented in a computer algebra system  after this we generalize to reed muller codes using multivariate polynomials  this in turn motivates the usage of algebraic curves  leading to algebraic geometry codes  where b√©zout s theorem is used as an essential tool for analysis the course consists of lectures  exercises and project work in groups teaching book written by the lecturers  accessible for free online this is a course on mathematics focusing on the engineering application error correcting codes  the main fields we will be concerned with are discrete mathematics  linear algebra and algebra   error correcting codes is not about programming  but about representing digital information in ways that are resilient to noise  it is used everywhere  in a dvd which can play flawlessly even though it is scratched  or a satellite transmission which is understood through bad atmospheric disturbance in stormy weather  or in high speed internet and in mobile phone conversations  without exaggerating  the information era would have been impossible without coding theory   many of the best error correcting codes we know are based on ingenious algebraic methods  this course is an introduction to the fundamental mathematical model in coding theory and to the mathematics behind these algebraic codes  in order for the recipient to correct whatever errors appear  efficient algorithms will be needed for handling the algebraic objects  we will deal with this using both theoretical algebra and using a computer algebra system   in a nutshell  we will use algebra and develop algebraic methods to find good solutions to mathematical problems inspired by applications of error correcting codes see also the homepage of the algebra research group  http   algebra compute dtu dk
