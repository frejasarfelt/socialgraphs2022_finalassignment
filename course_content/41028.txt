the course is divided into stages  in the first part  students with an electrical engineering background will be introduced to mechanical design and construction of different parts using cad modeling and 3d printers  while students with mechanical engineering and design and innovation backgrounds will learn about intuitive circuit analysis and design  and about programming of microcontrollers  in the second stage  students from all backgrounds will come together to learn how to design and build mechatronic systems  in thematic exercises  the students will be introduced to the use of sensors and data collection with microcontrollers  to components and software for iot enabled mechatronic systems  and the integration of electronics  software and simple prototyping techniques  3d printing and laser cutting  used for building initial physical prototypes  examples how to document and present mechatronic solutions  including the interactions between different domains  will be integrated in the thematic exercises  the third stage will then be devoted to the final project  and will focus on designing  developing  and building a functional   alpha prototype of a mechatronics product  or a key module hereof   which will incorporate the skills and knowledge learnt during the preceding stages of the course  the participants will work in interdisciplinary teams and will use the workshop facilities and laboratories at dtu mechanical engineering  dtu electrical engineering  and dtu skylab to realize their prototypes  the course concludes with a preliminary design review for each project  where the students will present their work  including project report  created prototype  and presentation   those that choose to do so will be able to use this feedback to iterate their products in 41029 design of mechatronic systems 2   students must declare their intention at the beginning of the course for whether they intend to continue on to 41029 design of mechatronic systems 2 lectures  assignments and project work in development teams lecture notes from teachers mechatronics is the synergy of mechanical engineering  electronic engineering  and information technology  the course objective is to give students from mechanical engineering  electrical engineering  and design and innovation backgrounds the basic cross disciplinary knowledge that is necessary for the design of mechatronic systems  and to finally enable them to develop and build a funtional alpha prototype in an interdisciplinary development team
