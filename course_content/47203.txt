students will apply basic thermodynamics  heat transfer  material selection  surface engineering  and design principles to design a solar energy harvester in the form of a solar cooker  students will work in groups of six to design  build and test a solar cooker and apply a system to control its temperature  selection of materials and system design to maximize collection of solar radiation will be key components that determine the efficacy of solar energy harvest and the appeal of the product for specific applications  students will learn how to go quickly from a novel concept to a prototype design   prerequisites to take the exam are to submit a project plan in the form of a gantt chart that includes a description of safety aspects for the whole project to be approved by a panel 3 week intensive design build course  students work in groups of six to design a small solar collector and then build and test it using prototyping techniques such as laser cutting and 3d printing  there will be lectures the first week and the final two weeks are hands on in the course we only use teaching material that is available online to learn the general principles of project management and achieve specific process targets using specified techniques  such as basic thermodynamics  heat transfer  surface engineering  and design principles this course is about the design and construction of functional prototypes and will give an introduction to solar energy harvesting   including solar concentrating collectors and optimized surfaces  the students will gain hands on experience by designing  building and surface optimizing a solar concentration collector in the form of a small solar cooker this course is part of the mandatory study plan for bsc in general engineering and will build on knowledge gathered from the previous two design build courses  students from bsc in general engineering will be given priority to the course   please be aware that due to the risk of harmful effects you can not follow this course if you are pregnant or breastfeeding  if you have questions regarding the above  please contact the course responsible
