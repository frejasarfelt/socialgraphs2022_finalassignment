lectures on the concept of microstructure and the mechanisms of the interaction of waves and  particles with the structure of solids as well as the response of materials to external and internal mechanical stress in relation to testing properties and performance  the principles of different characterization techniques  microscopy  diffraction and spectroscopy   including large scale facilities  and mechanical testing methods will be treated in relation to their application in materials science and engineering  the course consists of lecture classes  exercises  demonstrations and hands on experience of several of the characterization and testing methods lectures  exercises  demonstrations  laboratory exercisesan introduction to characterization and testing methods that can provide answers to the materials related questions  what does it look like  how is it build up  what is the composition  what can it stand b sc  students in general engineering are given priority
