the course focuses on theoretical lectures combined with computer exercises using matlab programming  the students will use and adapt existing bem and fem code in matlab  the comsol fem package may also be used  the formulation of the fem and bem in acoustics will be examined and developed with practical programming examples related with acoustical problems  there will be short exercises in connection with the theory  plus a larger assignment during the course that will be evaluated in the oral exam  the coupling of the acoustic model with other elements in the setup defined in different physical terms  such as mechanical systems  will be outlined lectures and computer exercisesn  atalla and f  sgard   finite element and boundary methods in structural acoustics and vibration   crc press  2015 introduce numerical methods used in acoustics  finite element method  fem  and boundary element method  bem   enable the students to define and create numerical models of acoustical devices and setups  couple them to mechanical models  and draw conclusions from the results
