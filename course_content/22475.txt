in this course we will go through the anatomy and physiology of the human hip joint  large tendons and the arterial wall  also  the necessary mathematics of vector and tensor analysis used in biomechanical problems will be adressed  the mathematical formalism is subsequently used to formulate the fundamental conservation laws in continuum mechanics and different types of constitutive equations  which in conjunction form the basis of all biomechanical modeling  examples include linear elastic  visco elastic  and hyper elastic tissue materials   we will read and discuss scientific papers describing various biomechanical problems to provide you with insight into how research is performed within these areas  the course also incorporates experimental work  where you will collect data to analyse a given biomechanical problem  demonstrations of biomechanical data collection will take place at the panum institute     during the course you will be given time to perform finite element analysis of the biomechanical problems where you have collected the necessary experimental data  you must hand in written reports describing your findings and the implications of the model results lectures  problem solving  lab exercises  homework problems and reportsthe course material is primary parts taken from e books available via dtu findit  1  j  d  humphrey  s  l  o rourke  an introduction to biomechanics   solids and fluids  analysis and design  2nd edition  springer  2015  2  f  irgens  continuum mechanics  springer  2008  3  s  c  cowin  s  b  doty  tissue mechanics  springer  2007  4  j  d  humphrey  cardiovascular solid mechanics   cells  tissues and organs  springer  2002  additional course material in the form of scientific papers is also used throughout the course the objective of the course is to give a thorough introduction to the phenomenology and fundamental principles of tissue biomechanics  further  will the mathematical foundation of continuum mechanics be presented initially  application of these mathematical models will focus on the human hip joint  the large tendons  and the blood vessel wall in arteries  both the anatomy and physiology as well as modeling of the mechanical behavior of the aforementioned structures will be taught   as a student  you will write reports describing lab exercises performed as part of the course within each of the three applied areas e learning is used in the form of an electronic correction system
