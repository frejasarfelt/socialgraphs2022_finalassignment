the course consists of 11 modules of lectures  each providing theoretical background and methodological tools for consistent assessment of bioresources   1  bioresources  concepts  terminology  relevant legislation 2  biomass characterization 3  biomass synthesis 4  biomass industry and alternative uses 5  biomass conversion to useful products 6  residue application on land 7  land use changes 8  ghg accounting 9  ecosystem services and functions 10  other impacts related to biomass utilisation 11  industry and commercial perspective  the tools gained throughout the course are in groups applied in an assessment addressing a specific bioresource  which is assigned at the beginning of the course lectures  exercises  group work  4 5 students   assignments lecture slides  scientific articles  notesthe overall objective of the course is to provide the students with a balanced ability to evaluate potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the use of bioresources for various needs in society  bioresources are natural organic materials  i e  materials derived from living things  which may be used in society for multiple purposes  to produce feed for animals  food for humans  feedstock  e g  timber  pulp  biomaterials  as well as energy  however  the supply and management of bioresources can result in significant environmental impacts  primarily because of the demand for arable land and forest products leads to enormous pressures on the natural environment  ultimately incurring losses of natural biomes such as natural forest  additional impacts derive from the management of these bioresources in society  for example in relation to processing  transport  and handling of the biomass residuals  with focus on the environment  the course provides an overview of bioresource characteristics and potential uses  highlighting potential competition and the connection with land use change impacts  further  the course applies accounting of greenhouse gases  ghg  as a tool to assess the climate impacts from the entire bioresource life cycle basic knowledge of chemistry and biochemistry is recommended to follow the course  you should have some experience with spreadsheet calculations  the course will teach you basic engineering skills like looking for data  formulating problems  and problem solving skills  while working in a team please contact the teacher for information on whether this course gives the student the opportunity to prepare a project that may participate in dtu s study conference on sustainability  climate technology  and the environment  gr√∏n dyst   more info http   www groendyst dtu dk english
