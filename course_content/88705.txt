the course will be divided into two parts  the first part will deal with introduction to process design principles  the stages of the process design life cycle and the preliminary design steps  flow sheet synthesis  equipment sizing costing  economic evaluation  scheduling of batch operations  distillation sequences  pinch analysis   the second part will deal with conceptual design  advanced process synthesis  such as heat integration  heat exchanger networks  reactor networks  reaction separation sequences  solvent selection   equipment selection  flow sheet optimization  the course will consist of ordinary lectures with minor exercises and major design project in group work lorenze t  biegler  ignacio e  grossmann and arthur w  westerberg  systematic methods of chemical process design  prentice hall  1997 the objective of the course will be to introduce the students to the principles and methods associated with the various stages of process design life cycle as a sequence of 12 hierarchical tasks  process design starts with a business decision to study the feasibility of process alternatives followed by a preliminary design  a conceptual design  and after several more stages  ends with the commissioning of the designed process  in this course  the stages dealing with preliminary design and conceptual design will be covered  in the preliminary design  emphasis will be given on how to generate and evaluate data  information  and on how to make simple calculations for preliminary design decisions and economic analysis  in the conceptual design  emphasis will be given to process integration  such as heat integration   environmental sustainability through pollution prevention and waste minimization in addition to computer aided techniques for process synthesis and design the course can only be taken by students in sdc program   chemical and biochemical engineering  biomass and energy  the course content will be identical to dtu course 28350 process design   principles   methods
