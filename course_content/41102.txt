hydraulics deals with fluids at rest  hydrostatics   and with air and water flows  hydrostatic pressure is introduced and the concept of buoyancy is explained  pressure forces on submerged and floating structures  basic concepts such as steady flow  uniform flow  and laminar and turbulent flows are introduced  the basis for hydraulics is derived from the conservation equations of mass  energy and momentum and applied in a number of technical problems  methods of calculating the head loss will be derived and used for the hydraulic design pipelines and open channels  for open channels  the concepts of  natural depth  specific energy  critical depth  hydraulic jumps and simple hydraulic structures will be introduced lectures and exercisesto give students an introduction to hydraulics and its application within civil and environmental engineering  related to caissons  reservoirs  rivers  channels  pipelines and hydraulic structures
