design and modelling of steam and gas turbine based power and co generation plants  with focus on renewable energy sources  mechanical and thermodynamic descriptions of the main components of the plants  construction of simulation models for the main components  control of power and co generation plants  fundamental theory about the design of steam turbines  including calculations for different types of turbine stages  fundamental combustion related calculations  power cycles using low temperature heat sources  e g  waste heat  geothermal heat  solar heat  biomass   solar power plants  normally  a visit to a large power plant is included in the course lectures and problem solvingin order to mitigate climate change  there is a need to increase the sustainability and effectiveness of heat and power production units  as well as increase the use of renewable energy sources for such plants  this course aims to provide the students with the fundamental understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of designing  modelling and operating power and co generation plants  with focus on renewable energy sources some parts of the course will be in english
