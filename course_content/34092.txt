maxwell s equations  optical green s function  local density of states  quantum emitter  dipole approximation  interaction hamiltonian  dipole radiation  spontaneous decay  classical lifetimes  far field emission  quantum light emitters  optical antennas  cavity quantum electrodynamics  simulation techniques based on modal and on green s function integral equation methods   the textbook  principles of nano optics  by lukas novotny and bernt hecht as well as lecture notes and articles will be used  curriculum is approx  250 pages   the course will consist of an introductory lecture after which the curriculum will be discussed in a study group format with student presentations and matlab exercises   for evaluation  oral exam in curriculum fundamental optics on m sc  level to establish a theoretical understanding of the semi classical light matter interaction in nanophotonic structures and of the engineering of the optical properties of these devices  since the light matter interaction is governed by the photonic environment  proper engineering of nanophotonic components requires a detailed understanding of the possibilities for tailoring the optical field to obtain the desired functionality  the curriculum will be based on textbook material as well as the latest dtu fotonik researchfor more information choose link to nano optics poster
