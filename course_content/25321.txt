the course covers fundamental concepts in fish nutrition and bioenergetics in aquaculture  we begin with the anatomy and morphology of the digestive system  and the information on dietary preferences that can be inferred  the course covers the macronutrients  examining the different amino acids and fatty acids  essential and non essential nutrients  and their roles in fish nutrition  nutritional requirements and essential nutrients are covered from a feed manufacture perspective  including considerations in the selection of raw materials  and the possibilities and limitations for substitution with alternative ingredients  we will examine feed intake  appetite  and digestive processes in fish  in addition to their energy use  and the substrates that are used to provide energy to the fish  students will formulate a theoretical experimental diet for a species of their choice and benchmark its performance using established assessment methods  the diet will be used in a model for production of fish in aquaculture lectures  exercises  problem solving  student presentations and written assignment the overall aim of the course is to introduce students to the field nutrition and bioenergetics of fish  and how it may be applied to individuals or groups of fish  the objective of the course is to provide students with an understanding of nutrition  how nutrients are assimilated  requirement for nutrients  and their metabolic fate  the course aims to provide the students with an insight into metabolism and respiration in fish  utilization of substrates  and how they can be measured  ultimately this should allow students to formulate a diet for fish that can applied together with a growth or production model this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly in achieving food security and promoting sustainable aquaculture  sdg2   sustainable consumption and production  sdg12   conserve and sustainably use marine resources  sdg14   and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems  sdg15
