biomaterials covers many application areas in healthcare  here we will teach biomaterial concepts relevant to regenerative medicine and drug delivery  the course will be organised on biomedical problems  treatment  or products  specifically  we will cover     synthetic and biological polymers  dna rna  proteins and lipids used to obtain biomaterials with specific properties     hydrogels for tissue engineering and cell scaffolds   tissue engineering including 3d printing  bioprinting and other fabrication methods    mammalian cell culture systems   nanoparticle based drug delivery  small molecule and biologic therapeutics      nanoparticle production using microfluidics and other technologies   gene therapy and transplantation  methods to characterise the effects  dimensions  and quality of the biomaterial  the course will use shorter labs and or demonstrations  e g  lipid nanoparticle synthesis using microfluidics  3d printing of cell scaffolds etc   to support the learning objectives and provide an applied focus to the course content the lectures are video recorded  and the course hours are used to define  solve and discuss relevant problems  posters  short lectures  and short case descriptions are used in training sessions  the short case stories will partly form the base for the written examinations  the course contains lab exercises and demonstrations with the aim to provide experience with biomaterial fabrication and characterisation pre recorded videos  lecture slides  peer review articlesthe course introduces the usage and fabrication of biomaterials for clinical purposes to students  specifically  the course will address regenerative medicine and drug delivery applications  in both application areas  biologically derived or bio inspired materials  lipids  proteins  dna etc  are used to construct for instance a carrier for delivering drugs to cancer cells with minimal side effects compared to the free drug  likewise  biomaterials are carefully chosen to guide stem cell development in tissue engineering for regenerative medicine the course will start for the first time in autumn 2023
