introduction to high performance computing techniques  emphasizing those aspects that are important in connection with numerical computations on large data sets large scale problems  usage of message passing paradigm  mpi   point to point and collective communications  non blocking communications  communicators  virtual topologies and one sided communication   numerical methods for large scale matrix computations  including how to efficiently determine an optimal partitioning scheme used  both for dense and sparse matrix linear algebra   application of the topics above on relevant models that require many hardware resources  e g  memory  cpu time  etc lectures  computer exercises and computer projects the advent of cost effective multi core computers has enabled researchers to carry out complex simulations on commodity hardware   the course aims at developing the necessary skills to exploit the potential processing power on modern computer architectures  this course builds upon the skills aquired in the course 02614   high performance computing   it gives an overview of existing software  methods and tools for large scale modelling  and enables the students to work with large scale problems in scientific computing and their implementation on modern compute clusters  the obtained knowledge will be applied in project work to model examples of large systems programming  in c or fortran  and implementation  as well as the usage of hpc systems   is an essential part of the course  contact the responsible course teacher about the prerequisites  the course material consists of notes handed out by the lecturers  the course covers modelling and the interplay between the model and methods in hpc  the course is aimed at students from all master programs
