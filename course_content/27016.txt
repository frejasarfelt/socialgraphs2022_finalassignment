this course will introduce concepts of the engineering process and apply some of the principles in a problem based setting  the problem  presented by the instructors  relates to designing and building a device for measuring the growth of single cell organisms in batch cultivations  teams will develop a project plan for the different aspects of the build  identifying the sub tasks and time plan  the device will be designed and implemented for the purpose of measuring and recording cell density in liquid culture over time  the measurement device will measure light absorption as an indication of cell concentration  the device will be analyzed for its performance with respect to accuracy  precision and range of linear detection  in addition  the device will be connected to a microcontroller for online data acquisition  a batch cultivation of baker s yeast  saccharomyces cerevisiae  will be performed and the cell concentration will be measured either online or via sampling  data collected from cells growing in exponential phase will be analyzed by the software system implemented by the team in python  matlab or r  a poster or video presentation will be used to communicate the results of the design build project  performance of the device  and results of the growth experiments 3 week course  january  problem based group projectsto be immersed in a problem based engineering project and solve a problem through teamwork  become familiar with the engineering process with a focus on the design and build  implementation  phases  be motivated to think about the engineering process in the context of cooperation in a project team this course is only available to students enrolled on the bachelor study line in general engineering  course work requires active participation in groups of 3  group work starts on day 1  adequate attendance in the 3 week period is required for attending the exam
