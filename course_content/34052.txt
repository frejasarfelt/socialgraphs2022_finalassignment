nonlinear effects in optics is becoming a more and more important topic  which is simply demonstrated by some of the recent applications and research topics within optics  high power short pulsed lasers  supercontinuum sources  sensors  and nonlinear signal processing  including transmission of high capacity signals  in the course relevant material properties are described and the interaction between light and matter is discussed  this is done through the susceptibility and an expansion of the induced polarization in a given material  the nonlinear wave equation is derived and applied to specific examples   during the course  two posters are requested from the participants  one after approximately four weeks and the other after approximately 9 weeks  in relation to the final evaluation of the course  the posters are weighted by approximately 20   of the total course  the remaining 80   of the course ore obtained from a project  which is carried out through the last 4 weeks of the course and the final exam  the project is concluded by handing in a report describing the project  the report will be presented at the oral exam  and as a requirement to the report  it has to contain elements from the first 8 weeks of the course lectures and theoretical exercises incl  poster presentations k  rottwitt  p tidemand lichtenberg   nonlinear optics  principles and applications  crc press  isbn 9781466565821at the end of the course the participants should be able to perform simple evaluations of nonlinear phenomena in optics  examples will be directed toward applications within optical communications  sensors and lasers this course is suitable as part of a ph d  study plan   see also course 34492   fellow teacher    peter tidemand lichtenberg  campus ris√∏  bygning 108  ptli fotonik dtu dk  phone   46 77 45 79
