separations based on the mechanisms of phase creation  agent addition and to some  though a lesser  extent solid agent  force field or gradient creation  barrier based separations are covered in a course dedicated to membrane technology  all topics are studied using combinations of diagrams  short cut approaches and simulations  extension of methods for multicomponent distillation and liquid liquid extraction  extraction cascades  special separation processes  selected topics  such as azeotropic separation  extractive distillation  reactive distillation  salt distillation  batch distillation  non equilibrium and sorption separation processes  databar exercises with programming  simulation of special and selected processes  mesh and mershq equations  process intensification  introduction of research topics  advanced process analysis lectures  problem sessions  databar exercises to enable the participants to use systematic methods in order to model  analyze and select technically important separation processes  graphical and short cut methods  as well as mathematical methods are employed  equilibrium and rate based methods are considered  the participants will aquire knowledge about and experience with computer aided tools for process simulation  design and analysis an ability to use the techniques  skills  and tools provided in this course  are necessary for the practice of chemical engineering in order to analyze how separation process design and selection affects the sustainability of processes and processing routes
