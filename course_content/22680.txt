this course caters to students in nano science  physics  biophysics  health tech  chemistry  and well beyond  its substance is core knowledge on which the understanding of all stochastic phenomena is based  including all experimental data analysis  examples used for illustrations are important cases chosen from physics  bio physics  and nano science  but even the examples are universal  as far as their math is concerned  and occur with just a change of units in other contexts  it is a hands on course  math is introduced when students in computer simulations observe phenomena that can be described mathematically and to develop data analytic tools  the data analytical methods will be applied to real and or synthetic data in mini projects throughout the course  the programming language used is matlab but python may be used by the student with a little extra effort  assistance with matlab python programming is offered  but some routine with such programming languages and mathematics is required weekly lectures  theoretical exercises  independent study  computer exercises  small projects lecture notesat the end of this course  participants should be able to  identify which elementary kinds of random behavior are likely to be encountered in a given situation and know how to decide if it is the case and to use it in data analysis and modeling of stochastic processes  perform basic estimation and curve fitting when data is subject to different types of stochastic influences  and validate their results by performing monte carlo simulations of elementary stochastic behavior of various kinds also recommended to msc students  e g  before or during the final msc project
