methods for finding minimum points of a smooth function  eg steepest descent  newton s and quasi newton methods   special methods for least squares approximation  e g   the levenberg marquardt algorithm  and minimax approximation  the course content is taught using technical case studies and available numerical libraries lectures and project work nocedal   wright  numerical optimization  2nd edition  notesan engineer is often faced with the problem of having to determine optimal values of the parameters in a mathematical model of a physical or technical problem  the problem is eg to find the parameters in a function so that the corresponding curve is a best fit to a given set of data points  or you may be given a mathematical formula that expresses the cost of producing a commodity or perform a transportation job   here you have to choose values for the free parameters so that the cost is minimized  the course deals with efficient methods for computing optimal values for the parameters in a mathematical model   the students will study and use available software libraries and learn how to construct their own programs prerequisite for course 02612  constrained optimization
