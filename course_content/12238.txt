the first part of the course covers selected key processes that control the fate  exposure and effects of organic pollutants in the environment   these processes fall within the general categories of transport  diffusion  advection  co transport   distribution  partitioning  adsorption  entrapment  and transformations  e g  biodegradation  photodegradation and hydrolysis   these processes will be introduced and described within an environmental organic chemistry context   the second part of the course covers a selection of key contaminant groups   1  legacy persistent organic pollutants  pcbs  ddts  dioxins    2  brominated flameretardants   3  fluorinated organic pollutants   4  polyaromatic hydrocarbons including alkylated and hydroxylated pahs   5  polymer additives   6  persistent  mobile and toxic chemicals  pmt chemicals    7  pharmaceuticals and  8  uvcbs   for each group  there will be emphasis on sources and inputs to the environment  physico chemical properties  distribution in environmental matrices  transport of compounds within and between matrices  abiotic and biotic transformations as well as environmental and human toxicity  in the lectures and exercises there will be special focus at identifying key substance properties and processes and at discussing how these affect the fate  exposure and effects of the specific chemicals  some of the lectures will be given by experts with active research on the specific contaminant group  the course complements the course 12237  chemicals in the environment   and is intended to provide a deeper and broader understanding of key processes and key pollutants within the area of environmental organic chemistry lectures  internal   external  and calculation computer exercisesas teaching materials is used a  set of notes  composed by teachers own notes supplemented with relevant literature the course will provide   1  general and specific knowledge about several  key organic pollutants and  2  general and specific knowledge of transport  distribution and transformation processes that control the exposure  fate and toxicity of these and other organic contaminants ams course the course has changed name from chemicals in the environment 2   key contaminants and processes  the course content is unchanged
