the course primarily focuses on topics within automated planning and multi agent systems  but will also address other areas of ai  e g  problem solving by searching  knowledge representation and reasoning with logical agents     the programming project concerns the design and implementation of advanced ai techniques in a simulated multiagent environment  the programming project is very open ended and invites for the development of your own algorithms and multiagent architectures  the project is carried out in groups  and should result in a working system and a video in which you present the system and its underlying ideas in the style of research presentations at ai conferences   in addition to the programming project there will be 2 smaller assignments during the course lectures  exercises  assignments and a large programming project this course introduces students to advanced techniques within artificial intelligence  ai   with particular focus on automated planning and multi agent systems  the objective of the course is to become able to explain  analyse and implement advanced ai techniques
