this course is focused on methods for solving the generic conservation law  and in particular its manifestation as the fundamental equations of a fluid flow   the navier stokes equations   we begin with the inviscid approximation to these equations  a potential flow  and work up to the full equations   the resulting partial differential equations are discretised and solved using finite difference and finite volume methods    the topics of  stability  numerical diffusion  linearisation  truncation error  convergence  and consistency are discussed  direct and iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations are briefly introduced    a series of solvers is built up during the course and applied to some simple two dimensional flows including   pipe flow  2d potential flows  and laminar lid driven flow in a square cylinder   tips are given for effective visualisation of the results using matlab  and comparison is made to benchmark results from the literature  these examples are used to guide the student through the process of building their own 2 d finite volume method solution to the incompressible navier stokes equations using matlab lectures  exercises with sample quizzes lecture notes to develop a finite volume method solution to the incompressible navier stokes equations in two dimensions   to gain experience in building a complex computer program in a modular and effective way using matlab   to compute examples of heat convection diffusion and lid driven flows and compare with benchmark results from the literature   to aquire some insight into the steps required to turn this code into a state of the art commercial cfd code problem solving in the data bar using matlab
