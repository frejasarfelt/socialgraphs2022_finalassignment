the course covers techniques for program analysis formulated as monotone frameworks  this includes the theoretical foundations as well as algorithmic techniques for solving constraint systems  there will be some consideration of applications to security and other ways of specifying program analyses   the students should make use of a number of classical program analyses for developing a minor analysis system lectures  theoretical and practical exercises the course is based on  program analysis   an appetizer  by f  nielson  h  riis nielson  arxiv 2012 10086  2020  as well as some material from  principles of program analysis  by f  nielson  h  riis nielson and c  hankin  springer  2005  isbn 3 540 65410 0   additional material will be made available on dtu s intranet and the systems on formalmethods dk will be used the students will be able to apply basic program analysis formalisms and to construct and apply the analysis tools and techniques facilitated by these formalisms attention  unfortunately the course has been cancelled in autumn 2022 bemærk  kurset er beklageligvis aflyst i efteråret 2022
