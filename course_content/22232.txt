drug delivery is a diverse area  but often nano and microtechnologies are necessary for developing a drug delivery system  it can be complicated to develop and understand these systems  and also to choose the optimal system  in this course you will get introductions to various technologies from academic and industrial perspectives  and also try out various techniques in the laboratories  there will also be a focus on micro and nanosensors in drug delivery   a field with a large potential  this course will run in parallel with the dtu health tech summer school  micro and nanosensors  with some joined lectures and sessions  moreover  there will also be focus on career development in academia and industry and inputs from start up companies    we will combine lectures on sensing principles in drug delivery and on nano and microtechnologies in drug delivery with hands on laboratory work  you will have the possibility to  1  develop technologies for drug delivery  2  test the application of the technology in relevant analytical methods or 3  explore micro nano sensors in the field of drug delivery and or pharmaceutical sciences   the experiments will be based on commercially available instruments as well as on systems developed at dtu health tech   the experimental work will be performed in teams and the developed technologies will be presented and discussed to be able to discover pros and cons on the various technologies and methods  by the end of the summer school you will in collaboration with the lecturers and your fellow students have generated an overview of technologies in drug delivery and the use of micro  and nanosensors in the area of drug delivery  to pass the course  you must take active part in the group work and in the scientific discussions  come and join us in this challenging endeavour   the course is for phd students only lectures  exercises in groups  discussions in groups and plenum and project work  you are expected to take active part in lectures  discussions  project work and exercises  you are required to present your own field of research as well as the results from the project work  performed in groups  the aim of the summer school is to provide an overview of nano and microtechnologies in drug delivery with examples of delivery technologies for peptides proteins and for poorly soluble drug  moreover  you will be introduced to analytical techniques such as raman spectroscopy and gain hands on experience in drug delivery technologies
