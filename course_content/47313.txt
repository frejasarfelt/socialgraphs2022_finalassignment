the transition of the energy sector from fossil based fuels and resources to renewables will require the development of efficient and safe energy conversion and storage technologies  solid state electrochemical devices that operate at elevated temperatures can convert chemically stored energy in form of biomass into electricity and  vice versa  produce high energy dense fuels from renewable electricity  solid state batteries are also more safe than conventional li ion batteries  but how does solid state chemistry of materials determine their electrochemical properties  what advantages and obstacles are related to a solid state electrochemical cell  the course will provide insight into the fundamental principles of solid state electrochemical cells  and will through selected hands on experiments make the participants familiar with solid state cell concepts and the mostly used performance characterization techniques such as impedance spectroscopy and linear sweep voltammetry  in the subsequent group work  materials chemistry structure performance correlations should be analyzed and summarized in two  article type reports and an oral presentation lectures and experiments safety in the lab is part of the course the course will be evaluated during the course periodin the course we only use teaching material   textbooks  assignments  articles  etc   that is available via e g  www  dtu library  dtu inside electrochemical devices such as fuel cells  electrolysis cells and batteries are considered key technologies in the transition of the energy system to become more sustainable  solid state electrochemical devices such as high temperature fuel and electrolysis cells as well as solid state batteries possess unique features such as operational flexibility  energy and resource efficiency   as well as safety   which makes them interesting for future energy conversion and storage applications  in a combined theoretical and experimental approach  the course will introduce the principles of solid state electrochemistry and its application in selected technologies such as fuel and electrolysis cells  batteries  sensors and gas cleaning devices in this course you will learn how solid state chemistry  materials science and engineering together with electrochemistry form an interdisciplinary development area for future efficient  safe and sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies for a more thorough theoretical introduction to the subject  it will be advantageous for the students to attend course 47319  more detailed knowledge on theoretical aspects of electrochemistry is given in courses 47305 and 47513
