the course focuses on theoretical lectures combined with computer exercises using matlab  and sometimes comsol  to solve structural vibration problems with and without acoustic coupling  solution methods will cover modal superposition and direct methods as well as various reduced order model  rom  techniques  different material and damping models  proportional  structural  will be analyzed and absorbing boundary conditions will be implemented for the simulation of wave propagation  power flow analysis and evaluation of kinetic  potential and dissipated energy in vibrating structures will be carried out  interaction problems are formulated and computations in the form of eigenvalues and forced vibrations are performed  complex finite element models for micro scale components are constructed    lectures and computer exercises serve basis for two reports lectures and computer exercisesloudspeakers and microphones are classical mechanical components that rely on the interaction between vibrations and acoustics  modern applications  industry 4 0  ranging from self powering of iot devices by energy harvesting of ambient acoustic energy  virtual sensing  medical equipment  biomechanics   life sciences  to novel mems based microphones and speakers  all rely on engineers with a fundamental understanding of vibration analysis of complex structures and their coupling to the surroundings  in order to enable such skills  the goal of this course is to teach the students to use the finite element method  fem  to solve advanced  multiphysics vibration problems with specific consideration to problems that involve acoustic mechanical interaction  this knowledge will be used to create complex finite element models for realistic assessment of the vibrations of micro scale components that involve acoustics at audible frequencies
