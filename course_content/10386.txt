the course offers to implement and investigate applications of quantum technology  working in groups the students will pick a particular quantum technology  study the theory behind it and plan its implementation considering various imperfections  after a detailed characterization of the components that shall be used the group will finally implement it   depending on the chosen technology the following topics may be studied    single photons from parametric down conversion sources   single photon detectors   hong ou mandel experiment   hanbury brown twiss experiment   violation of bell inequality with entanglement   quantum interferometry   optically detected magnetic resonance  odmr   special emphasis will be put on technical details an experimentalist has to deal with when demonstrating theoretical quantum optical predictions and when making use of those in practical measurement devices  the student is  thus  introduced to cutting edge technological challenges faced by quantum engineers project oriented experimental group work  project can be chosen from a list of topics related to quantum technology relevant literature will be included according to the particular need of each individual project group  there is no fixed curriculum for the course quantum effects such as quantum superposition and entanglement are now being used to develop radically new technologies with far reaching applications  including super secure communication  a new paradigm for computing  quantum computing   and sensors with unprecedented sensitivity based e g  on color centers in diamond  this is a true technological revolution and thus companies  like google and microsoft  are investing substantially in this new technology   the goal of this course is to experimentally explore some of these technologies with focus on quantum optical technology  this includes an understanding of the production  the detection and the characterization of quantum states  a special focus will be put on how to deal with unavoidable technical noise sources  present in all implementations  which disturb quantum effects
