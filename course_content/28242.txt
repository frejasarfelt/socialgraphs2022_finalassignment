basic kinetic concepts  theories of reaction rates  elementary gas phase reactions  reaction mechanisms and kinetic modeling  elementary reactions in solution  reactions on surfaces and heterogeneous catalysis  characterization of real catalysts and single crystal surfaces  microkinetic modeling and comparison to experimental rate expressions  basics on testing of heterogeneous catalysts including heat and mass transfer in catalytic reactions  discussion of selected bulk chemical heterogeneously catalyzed processes  the content of the course is relevant for sustainable production which will be illustrated in the course lectures  problem sessions  homework problemsnotes to be bought at the department of chemical enginering and i  chorkendorff and j w  niemantsverdriet  concepts of modern catalysis and kinetics  wiley  2003  note that the book may be downloaded from the dtu library to give the participants the theoretical basis of chemical kinetics and catalysis  so that they can use these basic concepts in the planning and operation of industrial chemical processes please contact peter glarborg concerning the part of the course dealing with gas phase kinetics and general questions   please contact anker degn jensen concerning the part of the course dealing with liquid phase reactions and catalytic reactions
