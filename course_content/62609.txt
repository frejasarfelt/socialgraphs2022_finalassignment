programming on the arduino platform and interconnection of a computer with sensors   actuators using public libraries  github   the programming is performed in programming language c and the code is executed on esp32 computers  there are no programming prerequisites for participating in the course  and the student will be given an esp32 computer for further work with the area after completing the course  examination of physical principle and electrical interface for different sensors and actuators and comparison of suppliers  data sheets with reality through practical experiments  review of different connection methods for sensors   actuators for the arduino platform  binary  analog  spi  i2c  review of how measurement data   control data is exchanged on a tcp   ip network via the modbus protocol  and how they are connected via the network to an industrial plc system  programmable logic controller   review and exercises with sampling  accuracy   precision  signal   noise ratio  operation and filtering  review and exercises with binary  analog pwm  pulse width modulation  and stepper motor control  the course is practically oriented and includes project work in two man groups with different experimental setups  the experimental setups are adapted to the working groups  current prerequisites  ability and interest  a hands on project is carried out in two man groups  where a mechatronic system is constructed  which  moves  controlled by a computer  the project goal is individual for each group and must be approved before it is started  the projects must include elements from mechanics  sensors   actuators and programming lessons and project workthe course gives students a practical introduction to how measuring and managing physical quantities is performed with a computer  through lectures and subsequent exercises  an understanding is gained of how a number of different sensors and actuators work  ie  their physical principle  electrical connection and use on a computer  the course participants design and build a functioning mechatronic system consisting of mechanics  sensors   actuators and software  the projects in the course are adapted to the individual student s prerequisites  ability and interest literature references  handed out notes articles on the internet comments  a dossier  1 5 pages  is handed in for each completed exercise  a report  10 15 pages  on the hands on project is submitted  dossier and report are used as a starting point for the oral exam
