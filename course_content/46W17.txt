this course gives you an introduction to the materials used in wind turbines and the loads they are subjected to  the focus in the course is on composites and metals  manufacturing  predicting and measurements issues are addressed  for the composites  the ability of tailoring  predicting and measuring the mechanical properties of non crimp fabric composites are addressed  for the metals  the properties of the most common steel types and the most common failure modes are addressed  the course will be given as a combination of online lectures  quizzes  demonstration videos  python jupyter notebooks and assignments used as a part of the final gradinge learningto give the student thorough knowledge of materials structures and properties  with special emphasis on the requirements in a wind turbine to make the student capable of tailoring and predicting the mechanical properties of wind turbine materials with an emphasis on composites and metals to make the student capable of designing materials test and critically use measured properties with the aim of designing selected sub components in a wind turbine to make the student capable of predicting materials life time of sub components given the load history
