in this course  the students will be introduced to bioinformatics methods in precision medicine  the students will learn how transcriptomics data from microarrays or rna sequencing can be used for diagnostics and patient stratification for selecting optimal treatments  the students will also learn the principles of precision and personalized therapeutics by analyzing rna and dna sequencing data   each lecture consists of an introduction to a clinical problem by a domain expert from translational research and or a clinician  followed by an introduction to how to solve the problem bioinformatically  followed by hands on exercises  the latter two will be based on the programming language r   the evaluation is based on hands on group projects  in which a precision medicine problem is solved  the students can either choose a predefined project or come up with their own  the examination consists of a group project presentation  followed by individual examinations in the full curriculum lectures  computer exercises  and group workthe curriculum for this course will consist of primary research articles  this list will be updated yearly and will appear on the course website at least 3 weeks before the course starts the aim of this course is to enable the students to apply a range of computational tools for precision medicine  in this course  we emphasize topics in precision diagnostics  such as patient stratification using gene expression profiling  as well as precision therapeutics  with a focus on identification and evaluation of targets for cancer immunotherapy
