after a general introduction to power system stability problems  characteristics and modeling of electric power transmission networks will be covered  followed by presentation of the characteristics and dynamic model for synchronous generator incl  power frequency and voltage control   after that  the different stability topics are treated  where the mechanisms of instability  countermeasures and theory for analysis are treated  the theoretical presentation of the power stability problems is followed up by stability analysis in python  where study cases are modeled and analyzed survey lectures  exercises and individual hand in assignmentsprahba kundur   power system stability and control   1994  isbn  0 07 035958 xto obtain knowledge about conditions in electric power systems that can lead to stability problems  to understand which physical mechanisms are the cause of power system instability  and to give the student insight in the theoretical background for analysis methods used for assessment of system stability    furthermore to obtain a deeper understanding of the mathematical models and the methods used for stability analysis  numerical simulations and analysis will be carried out on different stability problems where the students implement the appropriate models and methods for analysis in python during the course  few different forms of e learning activities will be carried for the purpose of supporting and enhancing the students learning     online lectures and assignment assistance by the use of adobe connect video conference sw   weekly online consultation hours  in adobe connect   where students can interact with the teachers to get assistance with problems related to their hand in assignments  this option is useful to support the students in efficient learning when they are working on class assignment during hours that are beside the scheduled classroom sessions
