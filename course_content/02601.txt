approximations and rounding errors  numerical algorithms for solving systems of linear equations  interpolation  numerical integration  roots in functions  linear data fitting  and ordinary differential equations  implementation and use of selected numerical algorithms in matlab lectures and exercises in the databar textbook  ward cheney   david kincaid  numerical mathematics and computing  7 th edition  brooks cole to perform a technical mathematical computation  such as evaluation of an integral or solution of a differential equation  on a computer  one must use numerical algorithms that define how the computations are performed efficiently and accurately   hence  numerical algorithms are the fundamental  building blocks  in most technical computations   whether they are done in matlab  c  or other languages  this course gives an introduction to the field of numerical algorithms  with focus on the interplay between the mathematical formulation of the computational problem and the practical implementation on a computers  specifically  in matlab    the aim is to give the student a basic understanding of how to perform mathematical computations on a computer mandatory course for mathematics and technology  the course is given in danish in the spring and in english in the fall the course gives a general introduction to numerical algorithms   it is a prerequisite for the following courses given by the scientific computing group at dtu compute   02526   mathematical modeling  02610 optimization and data fitting  02614 high performance computing  02616 large scale modelling 02623 the finite element method for partial differential equations   02624   introduction to inverse problems  02686   scientific computing for differential equations 1
