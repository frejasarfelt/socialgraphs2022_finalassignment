polymer reactions including step reactions  free radical  incl  controlled  and ion initiated chain reactions  are thoroughly deduced  special emphasis will be given to the understanding of reaction parameters important in the control of rate of polymerization  molecular weight distributions  and the structural composition like branching  cross links and stereo chemical aspects  the reaction mechanisms associated with the different polymerization reactions will be profoundly treated  in addition to this  also new types of bio based materials be discussed in terms of raw materials  substitution implications be discussed  recycling potential and sustainability  lectures  problem solving  group work and visit to a company the superior goals of the course is to make the students familiar with preparation methods for synthetic polymers including mechanisms  kinetics  modification of polymers by chemical reactions  and polymer degradation  furthermore  the students should be able to evaluate properties of the synthesized polymers
