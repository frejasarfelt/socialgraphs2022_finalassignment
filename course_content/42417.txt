the course focuses on teaching the students to design  build and use discrete event based simulation models for analyses of problems within operations management  based upon a wide range of specific complex planning problems it will be discussed how simulation models can be used to obtain knowledge on the system s operating performance  the students are taught to analyse complex systems within operations management and to define relevant key performance indicators    the students are introduced to a discrete event based simulation tool through a number of small scale practical assignments and introductory lectures  hereafter  the students are given a more extensive case study in which a specific simulation problem is solved in groups of two students  for the case study  an individual written report is prepared and handed in at the end of the course lectures  exercises and project worknotessimulation is an important dynamic tool in design and optimization of production and service systems  the purpose of the course is therefore to learn and understand the advantages  possibilities and limitations of simulation  the course will enable the students to design  implement and use discrete event based simulation models the students are encouraged to form groups of two students before the course start  students who are not part of a two person group by the start of the course will be assigned to a group to carry out the case study   physical presence is required at the written exam  which is held after the first week of teaching
