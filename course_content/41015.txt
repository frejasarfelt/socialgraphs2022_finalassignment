using a specific product as an illustrative example  e g  a bicycle  an understanding of the structural and functional properties related to the product and its sub components will be obtained  the following material groups will be treated  metals  ceramics  polymers  and composites  the physical concepts of friction  forces and moments  stresses  deformations and strains  uniaxial linear elasticity  plastic deformation and kinetic and potential energy will be introduced  these concepts will be related to the geometry and loading of structural components and also to material composition  i e  chemical structure  atomic bonding  crystal and phase structures as well as microstructures for composites and porous materials  the interplay between structural properties under load  material parameters and geometry is illustrated by simple examples of uniaxial tension compression  bending  torsion and buckling   organization  basic statics is learned through case studies of which an important part is the formulation of simple physical mathematical models for a given structure  software like cambridge engineering selector is used for interactive material selection  the knowledge obtained during the course is used during two poster projects  where the design of a structure is analyzed for statics and material choice   both from a mechanical as well as from functional criteria lectures  problem solving and project work in teams to obtain an understanding of the connection between the function of structures  their geometrical shape and the choice of material  including the possibility of changing the properties of the material by e g  heat treatment  the course treats basics of mechanics and the participants will learn to analyze stiffness and strength of simple structures and their sub components   including the influence of material properties  exercises include the formulation of simple idealized mathematical physical models  furthermore  the participants will obtain knowledge of the composition and properties of materials and will be able to select materials for simple structures only for bachelor students from design   innovation
