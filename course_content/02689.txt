subjects that will be covered in the course includes    spektral approximation methods   fourier approximations methods  periodic    polynomial approximation methods  non periodic    time integration and stability analysis   solution of linear and nonlinear pde problems   numerical solution of dynamical systems   consistency and convergence properties for spectral methods   numerical integration   derivation and analysis of advanced algorithms  fx  via projects lectures and assignment work in the databard  a  kopriva   2009   implementing spectral methods for partial differential equations  algorithms for scientists and engineers   springer the use of model based simulation tools on modern computers are increasingly being used in academia and industry for improving engineering designs and decision support   the course goal is to give a solid grounding in the developments of theory and practice in the use of advanced numerical computational methods for efficient solution of differential equations and for prediction in science and engineering  this includes development  analysis and application of advanced numerical methods and algorithms for the solution of any type of differential equations  fx  odes pdes sdes   we will develop and generalize ideas from finite difference methods  fourier methods and extend them to modern and flexible multi domain methods such as discontinuous galerkin finite element methods and spectral element methods  the experience gained in the course is useful for the numerical solution and prediction and study of mathematical problems where no analytical solutions exist or are readily obtainable  the methods are suitable for scientific computing  high performance computing  hpc  and is relevant for topics in modern uncertainty quantification  uq  and data driven scientific machine learning  sciml   the last project in the course can be defined in a scientific area of relevance to the participant
