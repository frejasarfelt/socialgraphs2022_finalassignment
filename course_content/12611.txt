the course will teach you to design hygrothermally correct and to diagnose hygrothermally incorrect building components and whole buildings  to those aims  the following issues will be discussed    criteria for building component durability and proper hygrothermal condition of building zones    heat  air and moisture balances    heat transfer revisited  conduction  convection  radiation  advection     moisture transfer  vapour diffusion  advection of vapour  liquid capillary transfer     air transfer  air diffusion     building materials and their hygrothermal properties  structural materials  insulation  air barriers and vapour barriers     mathematical methods  systems of equations  non linearity  control volume method     problem solving approaches  conceptualization  reliability lectures  group work  self study and assignmentsthis course will give you insight and skills to analyse heat  air and moisture transfer in building components and building zones   these will allow you to make hygrothermal designs for new building components and building zones  and to diagnose hygrothermal problems in existing building components and building zones   moreover  the course will give you proficiency in the required mathematical techniques and problem solving approaches
