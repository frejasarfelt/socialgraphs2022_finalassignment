the course focuses on advanced ecological models solved by numerical solutions of partial differential models  the students develop a 1d hydrographic model for a water column driven by the seasonal cycle of wind and temperature  including the nutrient  plankton  zooplankton  and detritus cycle  npzd model   this involves acquiring the basic theory for solving partial differential equations numerically  the model will be used to simulate the seasonal cycle of the hydrography and primary secondary production  a second model system is a size structured model of a fish population  formulated as a partial differential equation  the second part of the course involves application of an existing advanced model system  either the general ocean turbulence model or the mike ecolab system from dhi  finally  the students develop their own project  which could either involve extending one of the developed models  e g  applying it to a specific situation  developing a new ecological model platform  or apply existing professional ecological modelling tools  e g  to use dhis ecolab for a practical problem lectures  computational exercises and a project notes and a collection of articles the objectives of this course are to learn how to formulate  implement  and assess models of  life in the oceans and the interplay between life and the physical environment  the course focuses on hands on experience with developing programs for simulating life in the oceans and using existing professional tools this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  14  life below water
