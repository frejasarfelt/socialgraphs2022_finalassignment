we will study how computers execute programs and manipulate data  and explore the tools and methods involved  we will study what the tools  such as the compiler  do and we will train on using debuggers to eliminate defects and errors from our programs  computers consists of multiple parts with the processor being arguably the most important  in the course  we will study how a generalized processor executes programs so as to reach a solid understanding of how computers behave  we will also study how programs  including variable contents  are encoded to be executable   most modern computers are connected in large networks  in many cases it is unthinkable to have computers without access to networks  such as the internet  we will in the course study how computer networks fundamentally work and how you write programs allowing computers to communicate over the internet  but also internet of things lectures  exercises and projects work computer systems have become an integral part of our society  they are the foundation for a wide range of technologies from internet of things and smartphones to the cloud  in this course  we will study how modern computers work  we will understand what the limitations of computers are as well as what opportunities are possible the course is given within the bachelor education in general engineering
