linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout the natural sciences and engineering   in this course we will cover    vectors  matrices  direct sum and kronecker product of matrices    various matrix types  block matrices  householder  hermitian  positive  semi  definite  unitary  orthogonal projections  normal  circulant  pseudo inverse   etc    norms and inner products  induced norms  frobenious norms  etc     matrix factorizations diagonalizations  qr factorization  schur s triangularization  spectral  eigenvalue eigenvector   jordan normal form  singular value decomposition  svd   polar decomposition    specific linear transforms  householder reflections  convolutions  circulant matrices   discrete  fast  fourier transform  dft fft    gershgorin s disc theorem  bounding the eigenvalues   the convolution theorem  the cholesky factorization   this course is a continuation of the linear algebra from mathematics 1  but with emphasis on proofs and insight and with less focus on maple computations and applications  in particular  we will prove the dimension and the spectral theorem which are mentioned and applied in mathematics 1 without proof  the proofs will whenever possible follow strategies that allow for stable numerical implementations  e g   the proof of qr factorization  which in itself is an important tool for numerical solutions of least squares problems and computing eigenvalues  relies on householder transformations  we will  however  not do the actual implementation  our focus is that the proofs should provide insight lectures  in danish  and class exercise sessionsstephan ramon garcia and roger a  horn  a second course in linearalgebra  cambridge mathematical textbooks 2017 supplement text   linear algebra done wrong by sergei treil  https   www math brown edu  treil papers ladw ladw_2017 09 04 pdfto provide the students with the mathematical background on advanced linear algebra that is used in  mainly  applied mathematics  but also computer science  statistics and physics as well as machine learning  data science  etc   the main focus is on  finite dimensional  inner product spaces  linear transforms on such spaces  and matrix factorizations such as qr  svd  and dft fft    the course style is blackboard lectures and pen and paper exercises   computer programs as maple  matlab  pyhton  etc  will only play a marginal role  on the other hand  the course will give insight into the structure of linear algebra that is incredible powerful for the solution of a large range of engineering problems  the course also aims to state all results clearly and prove them rigorously  this will strengthen the ability to handle abstract mathematical objects  to understand mathematical results and proofs  and to prove results yourself
