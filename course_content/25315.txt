the course is based on cases illustrating application of modern dna based methods in aquaculture and on hands on laboratory work using state of the art methods  the course reviews the importance and relative success of aquaculture activities encompassing a selective breeding program  common goals for aquaculture breeding  such as productivity  disease resistance  flesh quality and fish welfare are presented   basic concepts of population and quantitative genetics relevant for aquaculture are introduced  important terms such as selection  inbreeding and heritability are defined  followed by application of large scale genome rearrangements  i e  manipulation of sex and chromosome number  and production of gmo  genetically modified organism  fish using gene transfer among species   the is followed by specific applications of dna based methods in aquaculture  including laboratory exercises a major topic is the use of dna methods for identification of a  suitable broodstock  b  individuals c  families and for d  tracing fish products back to the producer in a forensic context  a second major application is for locating sites in the genome   mapping   that influence the trait of interest for selective improvement  so called qtl  quantitative trait loci  mapping  including how this information can provide faster and more efficient selection through mas  marker assisted selection  and wgs  whole genome selection    the course includes group work on a practical aquaculture breeding case study defined and developed by the students in association with the course responsible teachers  the final part of the course will be a discussion on interactions between wild fish and fish in aquaculture  the ultimate goal will be to design a strategy for avoiding and monitoring potential genetic threats to natural biodiversity  thus assuring sustainable future aquaculture lectures  guest lectures  group work and computer exercises the aim is to provide students with knowledge and practical laboratory based experience of the application of modern dna based  methods in aquaculture  students will learn about classical breeding methods and how genetic and genomic tools can lead a more efficient attainment of breeding goals  the course encompasses the newest developments in mediating large scale genome rearrangements such as manipulation of chromosome number  sex and gene transfer from other species and organisms  gmo   the main focus is on the application of genetic markers for multiple purposes including a  identification of suitable wild broodstock b  identification of individuals and families c  avoidance of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity d  genomic mapping and marker assisted selection  mas  of traits important for e g  production  quality and fish welfare e  traceability of fish and fish products back to producer  in addition functional genomic tools such as rna microarrays and their application for studying gene expression will be presented  further  an introduction to the multitude of web based genomic resources and how to access them will be provided  finally  potential interactions between wild and domesticated fish and how to monitor them will be discussed in order to assure sustainable and biodiversity friendly aquaculture this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  2  zero hunger    3  good health and well being    12  responsible consumption and production   and  14  life below water
