the course deals with methods for representation and quality assessment of data  parameterization of physical systems  description of empirical and analytical relationships between data and model parameters  stochastic description of uncertainties and noise  and stochastic and deterministic quantification of prior knowledge about a physical system    a number of analytical numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear inverse problems are presented  the propagation of noise in the data to uncertainty of the solutions is a major theme in the course lectures  exercises  and small projects to give the students insight into the mathematical description of measurements  laboratory  observatory  satellite and field data  and their application to the study of astrophysical and geophysical systems
