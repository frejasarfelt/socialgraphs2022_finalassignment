the course will comprise 13 lessons  these will include shorter lectures  discussions of literature that the students have read  simulations and experimental demos    it will also comprise 4 homeworks  each taking nominally 6 hours   the course introduces the student to modern concepts of imaging with x rays emerging from advanced laboratory based sources and large scale accelerator based x ray sources  building upon the a priori knowledge of materials bio structures the student learns the concepts of diffraction contrast and near field image formation  the mathematics of tomographic reconstruction and practical experience using available tools will be covered  the lectures will include a hands ons simulations with the aim to establish the connection between the theory and software implementation    the lectures and exercises will cover in particular the following topics    the physics behind propagation of x rays in media    photon matter interactions  attenuation  scattering and diffraction in connection with imaging    image formation in an x ray microscope    diffraction contrast imaging  grains  defects  and stress in 3d    simulations of propagation of coherent wavefronts   tomographic reconstruction algorithms and their implementation   hands on sessions with simulations and 3d data reconstructionslectures  homework  simulations  experimentsj  als nielsen   d  f  mcmorrow  elements of modern x ray physics  john wiley   sons  ltd  2011  j  goodman  introduction  to fourier optics  w  h  freeman  2004  p c  hansen  j s  j√∏rgensen  and w  r  b  lionheart  computed tomography  algorithms  insight  and just enough theory  siam 2021 x ray imaging and microscopy is utilized in all aspects of life  from hospitals through basic science to industry and museums   in the  past 30  years we  witnessed  a  rapid development using both  synchrotrons and lab sources for x ray imaging with many new modalities and application areas  the variety is large  but all methods share the same underlying principles  which will be presented in detail in the course    the course will provide student with a comprehensive view of advanced x ray imaging methods  such as phase and diffraction contrast tomographic and emerging coherent microscopy techniques  the course aims to establish a connection between the theoretical description of  image formation and the application of the methods across materials science   biology and other domains  the students will become familiar with simulations of x ray images and movies and independently interpret complex 3d data   the know how  obtained in this course is relevant for becoming an expert in r d in the area in academia or the rapidly growing x ray industry
