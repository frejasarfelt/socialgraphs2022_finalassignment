the application of scientific methods  either theoretical or in the lab  is a main part of the phd projects at dtu energy  the objective of this course is to make sure that the student gets sufficient and high quality training and experience with the methods that play a core role in the phd project  so that the phd student can work independently with the methods on a level required to produce high quality scientific results   the student and the supervisors should choose the methods which are relevant for the phd project  at least one method must be chosen  the course can include training in more methods at the same time  3 ects points corresponds to 84 hours of work  if the hours spent on training are expected to exceed 84 hours  then please consider to sign up for the 5 ects point version of this course   the practical training may be delegated to colleagues with strong competences within the method  it can be other phd students  postdocs  technicians  or others  the supervisor will decide whether the trainer is qualified    to pass the course  the person s  responsible for the training determine s  that the phd student can work independently with the method s   the student will inform the supervisor that he she has passed the training  after this  the phd student and the phd supervisor will agree on the time for the exam  e g  as part of a supervisor meeting  the main phd supervisor and at least one co supervisor must participate in the exam  the student must  a  present examples of results output from the method s  and discuss those and  b  describe how the method s  is are planned to be used in the phd project  the course is passed if both phd supervisors agree that the learning objectives have been met  when the exam has been passed  the supervisor must inform the course responsible by email so that the course completion can be registered the objective of this course is to learn in practice how to use one and or more experimental or theoretical methods to be used in scientific research only for phd students at dtu energy
