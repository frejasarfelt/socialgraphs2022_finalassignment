the combination of the increasing availability of data in energy systems and of the liberalization of energy markets bring a number of opportunities and challenges in the operation of energy systems  the course will mainly concentrate on the case of electricity  though it will be explained how similar concepts and methods are also valid for other energy systems e g  heat and gas    a compact introduction to energy markets will be given  by defining wholesale and retail sides  as well as the cost structure for electricity  then the point of view of consumer and prosumers will be taken  in parallel  the different types of data of relevance will be introduced  like smart meter and meteorological data for instance  to be used as input to analytics and optimization  subsequently  emphasis will be placed on a number of analytics and optimization problems  for the profiling of consumers  the optimal scheduling of consumption and storage  etc  for that purpose  methods from statistical learning e g  regression and machine learning  as well as operations research e g  linear programming  will be introduced and employed in the context of smart electric energy consumption  finally  the students will use the python programming language for processing data  implementing analytics and optimization methods  as well as for various types of visualizations lectures  exercises and project workthe main aim of the course is to unveil the opportunities at the interface of digitization and energy markets  by going through some introductory concepts in analytics and optimization
