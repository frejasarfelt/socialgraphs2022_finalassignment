the primary goal of the course is for students to learn a modelling method that has the potential to support complex system operation  on the generic level  all form of modelling activities happens in two steps  the first step is  interpretation   when the modeller acquires knowledge and principles of the modelled subject  and the second step is  representation   when the modeller reconstructs the knowledge in a pre defined formal language  i e  to build a  model  that mimic the behaviour of the modelled subject  the course will be conducted following this general modelling framework  by firstly introducing the features of the complex engineered systems and the challenges in their daily operation  the students shall learn to analyze the design and control of these systems and specify the operation goals and functions  the course will then introduce the theory and method of functional modelling and its application  implementation of knowledge systems  to support complex plant operation  the students shall learn to build function models and use the model to analyze plant operation scenarios lectures  exercises  and group work the purpose of this course is to introduce students to a function modelling methodology  multilevel flow modelling  to analyze operational problems in complex industrial plants including diagnosis and decision support  the course demonstrates knowledge based systems for diagnosis  planning and design from a plant wide perspective
