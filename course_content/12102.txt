mass balances chemical equilibria acids and bases   carbonate chemistry  chemical precipitation  complex formation phase distributions in two  and three phase systems  water  solid gas  redox systems ion exchange sorption  flow in porous systems  soil properties  emphasis is put on learning the theoretical principles through practice oriented activities  project work and lab  exercises  in addition  emphasis is put on communication of results in the form of well structured reports lectures  exercises  3 laboratory exercises and project work in groups the textbook for the course is  environmental engineering science  of ww nazaroff and a alvarez cohen  which can be purchased at the dtu book store  additional teaching materials  lecture materials  assignments  practice presentations  additional compendia etc   will be available at dtu learn the overall aim of the course is to  get a quantitative understanding of important physical chemical and microbiological processes that control    concentrations of compounds in the environment   concentrations of compounds in environmental engineering reactors technical installations create the foundation for more advanced courses within water technology and water pollution illustrate how the engineer works with practical issues the course is a prerequisite for the majority of the courses offered by dtu environment  as a consequence  it should be taken early during the studies
