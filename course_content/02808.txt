the course draws upon theory  methods  and techniques from human computer interaction  hci   pervasive ubiquitous computing  and mobile wearable computing for the purpose of prototyping  modeling  and evaluating personal data interaction  the information life cycle of data acquisition  analysis  presentation  visualization   reflection  and action is addressed  focus is on creating personal informatics systems and interfaces enabling self tracking and interaction with and learning from personal data  there is emphasis on data visualization in the course    throughout the course students work in groups on multiple exercises  assignments and a final project  which involves prototyping and evaluation of user interfaces for personal data interaction  the course has a broad interpretation of  mobile   that is  any mobile form factor including smartphones  tablets  smartwatch  self tracking and sensing devices  prototypes are built in any practicable technical platform as the focus is on the interaction and application aspects lectures  exercises  assignments and project worka textbook on human computer interaction is used in combination with a collection of research papers the overall course objective is to enable students to create and evaluate interfaces and interaction with personal data on different platforms the course focuses on interaction aspects and includes prototyping techniques to create user interfaces supporting the interaction with personal data on mobile wearable devices groups will be formed at the first lecture  students not present at the first lecture will not maintain their registration in the course  it is assumed that students already have sufficient programming experience to develop prototype apps and data visualization in different platforms
