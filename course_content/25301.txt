the course starts with an introduction to the basic processes of primary and secondary production and microbial degradation  as well as an introduction to habitats and food webs in different types of aquatic systems  then  the students will be introduced to the main anthropogenic threats to aquatic systems and potential mitigation strategies to reduce the human impacts  the course will enable students to understand and pursue a research based approach in the management of aquatic systems  by using research on fish physiology and behaviour as an example  and demonstrate how aquatic ecology can be applied in the fields of aquaculture  fisheries  or oceanography  the course addresses the un sustainable development goal  14  life below water   particularly its targets to prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution  14 1   sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems  14 2   regulate harvesting and end overfishing  14 4  and conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas  14 5   the course includes lectures  classroom exercises  guest lectures and student presentations this course introduces the students to the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems  with examples of processes  habitats  and key organisms in both marine and freshwater ecosystems  the course progresses with examples of how ecosystems and their species are influenced by a variety of human activities  and how environmental impacts can be assessed and managed  and how aquatic ecosystems can be restored  the course is introductory and particularly relevant to students with little previous knowledge about aquatic ecosystems but may also be useful for students familiar with ecosystems but with little knowledge about human pressures and or behaviour and physiology of organisms  the course has a focus on six overarching themes  a  an introduction to basic ecological processes  primary production  microbial remineralization and secondary production which determine the structure and productivity of an aquatic ecosystem b  an introduction to marine and freshwater ecosystems including their specific habitats and key organisms c  an introduction to how humans impact marine and freshwater ecosystems and examples of how such impacts can be mitigated d  an introduction to aquaculture  types of production systems used  species in culture  fundamentals of nutrition  nutrient discharge  and the solutions for increased sustainability e  an introduction of how the science of fish physiology and fish behaviour can result in better understanding of ecosystem functioning and the consequences of human impacts on it f  an introduction to how the students can use their knowledge of aquatic ecosystems to work within aquaculture  fisheries  oceanography  or management of aquatic ecosystems and their resourcesgeneral competence course  msc  eng   aquatic science and technologythis course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  6  clean water and sanitation    12  responsible consumption and production    14  life below water  and  15  life on land
