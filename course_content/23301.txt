for both  research  control and food production good valid analytical results are very important  practical chemical food safety includes aspects of chemical analysis and control of unwanted chemicals in food and add skills to e g  food production staff to be able to evaluate the validity of analytical data from third parties  sample preparation includes fat soluble as well as water soluble components and the techniques applied  before analysis of food samples separation from other food components are often necessary and include extraction  e g  ple  sonication  ultra thurrax  and clean up  e g  gpc  spe   many analytical techniques  e g  gc ecd  gc ms  lc ms  icp ms  are applied for detection of both organic and inorganic food contaminants  principles and examples of the analytical techniques will be presented together with risk based evaluation of data  also  legislation and requirement of chemical control  including method validation and basic requirement of accredited analysis are important skills to obtain to be able to evaluate data lectures  exercises  group work  laboratory work  student presentationthe objective is to give the students a practical experience in application of analytical chemistry in case based project work related to food products  elements of method validation and experimental design is applied in relation to practical chemical analysis and chemical risk assessment of food  the course provides the basis for evaluation of analytical data by applying quality control parameters  analytical chemistry and statistical analysis on own data  laboratory work for assignment and report writing are required master students on food technology and applied chemistry have priority for this course
