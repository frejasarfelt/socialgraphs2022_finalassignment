this course introduces electron microscopy as a method for characterizing the microstructure  crystallographic orientations and local chemistry of metals and alloys  students will learn the operating principles of the transmission and scanning electron microscopes  and how to obtain and interpret images  diffraction patterns and energy dispersive spectroscopy data  in addition  each student will be involved in practical work using at least one of the electron microscopy techniques  this form of study will involve discussion with and guidance from a member of dtu staff    topics will include    	main components of electron microscopes   	interaction of  electrons with solid matter  	electron detection for different signals and image formation in tem and sem  	different types of tem contrast  diffraction contrast  mass thickness contrast  phase contrast   	imaging tem techniques  bright field  dark field  high resolution    	spectroscopic methods   	diffraction patterns in tem and sem  ebsd   	specimen preparation for tem and semlectures  group work  hands on experiencethe course aims at providing a basic theoretical understanding of the principles of electron microscopy  with special emphasis on analysis of crystalline materials  therefore  prior basic knowledge of crystallography and crystal defects is essential in this course  the course will enable the participants to understand and interpret electron microscopy images  diffraction patterns and energy dispersive spectroscopy data obtained using scanning and transmission electron microscopes  specimens analyzed during the course will represent metals and alloys   the course is recommended for phd students  active learning will be applied in this course
