the course will cover the biological background for affinity based reactions that are the backbone in most optical biosensors based on evanescent sensing in waveguide geometries  this also includes surface plasmon resonance  spr  based sensors  the principles of luminescent sensing covering both spectral and lifetime based methods will be covered  a number of optical biosensors used for life science  clinical as well as r d purposes will be discussed  an integral part of the course is that students present scientific papers in journal clubs  throughout the course  practical examples and demonstrations will be used whenever possible  we will also visit companies manufacturing optical biosensors to observe how the theory acquired throughout course is put into work in real life applications  the purpose of these company visits is to make the students acquainted with how the companies evaluate the applicability and feasibility of an optical biosensor before going to production  the regulatory issues pertaining to optical biosensors will also be a part of the company visit lectures and journal clubsoptical biosensors cover a wide gamut of applications ranging from simple test kits used by general practitioners to complex analytical devices used in life science and biomedical applications  the objective of this course is to make the student capable of analyzing the optical and biomedical aspects of these sensors  furthermore  issues pertaining to specificity  sensitivity and signal to noise ratio  limit of detection  of such sensors will be discussed during the course  it is also the objective of this course to enable the student to assess which optical biosensor design s  can be implemented for a given sensing application  based on the analysis of the interplay between materials  components  systems and signal processing in the field of optical biosensing lecturers from dtu fotonik  dtu health tech and a number of invited external lectures
