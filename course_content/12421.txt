laboratory testing  advanced soil behaviour  constitutive equations  yield criteria  plasticity theory  strain softening and hardening lectures  laboratory work  group work to enable the participants   on the basis of an advanced knowledge of strength and deformation characteristics of soils   to formulate commonly used models of soil behaviour including elastic perfectly plastic  tresca and mohr coulomb  and cam clay and to assess their advantages and limitations  the participants will develop the ability to select the appropriate soil parameters from laboratory tests and use them to analyse a wide range of geotechnical applicationsthis course is a prerequisite for advanced geotechnical engineering and constitutive models and plasticity in soil mechanics
