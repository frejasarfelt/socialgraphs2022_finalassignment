the course will start with an introduction to the use of linux systems  followed by basic knowledge about astronomical detectors  calibration  measurement significance  and noise sources  the participants will be trained in reducing imaging and spectroscopic data and perform photometry  the students will learn about single dish and interferometric observations at millimetre and radio wavelengths and will get to reduce and analyzeÂ continuum and spectroscopic data  x ray data will be provided from currently flying x ray instruments  e g  nustar  integral  nicer   all lectures will be followed by hands on exercises based on the methods and techniques described during the lectures  example applications include analyzing the spectra of galaxies and supernova explosions  applying techniques to find exoplanets  measuring the molecular content of distant galaxies  and studying thermonuclear explosions on neutron stars lectures and practical exercises to give the students a working knowledge of astronomical data acquisition  analysis  and scientific exploitation  the course will train students in using professional software and tools to analyze real astronomical data from a series of different wavelengths and telescopes
