the course will provide the students the fundamental theoretical and practical skills that are required to work in a molecular laboratory  focusing on complex organisms  these skills will be acquired through lectures  exercises and end to end laboratory activities    the topics addressed will be    	working with dna  chemical background and instruments used  from extraction to quality control  	nucleic acid databases and oligonucleotide primer design theory  	oligonucleotide primer design  hands on   	dna extraction  hands on   	pcr with primer designed by the students and output evaluation  hands on   	applicability of dna based molecular tools in research used to solve real life problems  	working with rna  chemical background and instruments used  	rna extraction and quality control  hands on   	cdna synthesis  hands on   	real time pcr and evaluation of qpcr outputs  theory and hands on   	qpcr data analysis  absolute and relative quantification  exercises with real data   	applicability of rna tools in scientific studies  what to consider  	from low throughput to high throughput methods and their applicationscombination of lectures and laboratory exercises the course aims at providing students hands on and theoretical bases of common practices for processing dna and rna from complex living organisms  i e  plants and animals  including humans   the course will provide the students with fundamental skills in scientific molecular techniques and an overview of different applications  from basic to applied research   this will be achieved through a combination of in class and in laboratory activities remember to bring a laptop  course materials will consist of laboratory protocols  scientific articles  selected book chapters  video and original material  this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  3  good health and well being    14  life below water  and  15  life on land
