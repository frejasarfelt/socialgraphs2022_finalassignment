one or more topics within measurements of antenna radiation  polarization and gain  particularly near field measurements and near field to far field transformation laboratory course with both experimental and theoretical exercises as well as a few lectures   the course contains all day activities every day in the 3 week period j e  hansen  ed     spherical near field antenna measurement   iee electromagnetic waves series 26  peter perigrinus ltd   1988 the students must acquire knowledge about measurement of antenna parameters in radio anechoic chambers and a skill to conduct such measurements the teaching in january 2023 will be canceled as essential parts of the course have transferred to 30430 advanced antenna techniques and measurements  the course is planned to be given again from 2024 with some changes to its content to take full advantage of the newly established dtu electromagnetic test centre   recommended in the 3rd semester of the m sc  program the practical work is conducted in the dtu electromagnetic test centre  which includes dtu esa spherical near field antenna test facility  which dtu operates in collaboration with the european space agency   e learning is used in the form of simulation tools and numerically generated data   due to the laboratory work  this course has participant restrictions   priority is given to those who have passed the course 31430 advanced antenna techniques and measurements  second priority to those who are signed up for the exam in the course 31430  while others have third priority   the practical work requires full physical capability
