the cdio concept is applied at the course  conceive  design  implement and operate using engineering methods to problem solving  laboratory experiments and theory on fermentation kinetics and technology  as well as downstream processing of fermentation products using different methods  such as membrane processes  filtration  crystallization and centrifugation  with focus on the unit operations involved batch  fed batch and chemostat  bioreactor design  mixing and aeration  media design and sterilisation  instrumentation and control of fermentation processes  there will be developed a definition of the problem to be examined  experimental plan  statistical treatment of results and literature searching  the students will work individually as well as in groups with theoretical and practical exercises and a project  the project is a theoretical project that concerns design of a fermentation process including downstream processing classroom lectures  theoretical and practical exercises  group work  industrial visits  if possible   project  theory and exercises will be integrated the individual student will be able to develop a solution to a biotech process problem and consequently be able to participate in operation and development within this area  more specifically the student will after the course be capable of suggesting strategies for design of a fermentation process based on knowledge about kinetics and microbial metabolism  skills in selection of appropriate unit operations for the downstream process will be acquired  furthermore  the student will be able to conduct simple lab techniques and obtain physical  chemical and biochemical data for use in calculations teaching material and most of teaching occurs in english  participation in industrial visits is compulsory  active participation in the 13 weeks practical exercises is necessary for successful participation in the 3 weeks project
