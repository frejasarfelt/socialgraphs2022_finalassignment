the course is organized around lessons  exercises and design assignments  initially  visual programming in relation to construction is introduced  the lessons deal with parameters  framework conditions  model techniques  model definitions  during the course  the students get the opportunity to build and implement models with open and fixed parameters  the models are used to calculate or simulate building physics and building statistics  the course introduces topics such as interoperability  model couplings  file formats input  output between tools  the course creates an understanding of linear modeling processes and more advanced processes such as recursion and generative processes  here  automation and optimization are introduced as topics and the students get access to test the methods on their own models  the course uses knowledge from previous courses and new tools are used to model thermal conditions and conditions of structural design lectures  individual assignments  and group assignments to introduce different modeling approaches within building design using software  to gain insight and understanding of different types of models used under building engineering disciplines  to acquire competencies within visual coding and scripting in model contexts  to gain the ability to understand and model digital representations of reality  and to use results to justify building design choices  the course expands the participants  understanding of building information modeling  bim  as a concept  especially with a view to integrating and parameterizing models
