the 5 days course is primarily based on a combination of practical work  hands on  and theoretical presentations  this course will focus on the use of histopathology in fish diseases  combining a general histopathological approach with pathogen specific techniques such as immunohistochemistry  ihc   the first day participants will be shown how to take optimal samples for histopathological evaluation  considering different tissues and fish sizes  in the afternoon  lectures in pathology and histopathology will begin  during the next days  the participants will continue the training track with a combination of lectures and practical work and will be introduced to special staining methods or pathogen detecting techniques like ihc  one and a half day is dedicated to histopathology in crustacean diseases  the course gives an introduction to general pathology and the specific histopathological lesions and lesion pattern that occur as a consequence of disease  focus is put on the understanding of general pathological processes and on training in histopathological diagnostic skills  the course is dialogue based and sufficient time will be given for discussion under way  a social dinner will be organized the second evening during the course each participant is given an individual assignment  and is involved in the discussion of the topics presented  furthermore participants are gathered in small working groups  2 3 people each  and receive theoretical assignments to solve based on presentation given during the course  i e  designing a protocol for immunohistochemistry   the course participants are expected to prepare for the course the course aims to introduce participants to the use of histopathology in fish and crustacean diseases  combining technical knowledge on how to process samples  including collection  fixation and the detection and description of lesions  which can be observed during different disease stages of systemic infections  the course will be structured on two main pillars  1  an overarching part on how to approach histopathology and combine theoretical knowledge on specific lesions to diseases patterns  and 2  a more specific part on immunohistochemistry  describing pitfalls and application of these techniques to specific pathogens    lectures will include descriptions of the techniques with major focus on their application  pitfalls and trouble shooting  practical sessions and show and tell sessions will allow participants to spend time on the microscope individually observing prepared slides  open discussion as well as one to one supervision with the tutors    overall  the course will allow participants to understand the underlying principles of the histopathology and specific techniques such as ihc  thus increasing the ability to evaluate histological slides and critically review results based on histopathological examination  furthermore  the course will allow the participants to obtain a better understanding of specific staining methods thus increasing the ability to critically review these methods in order to assess pitfalls and to correctly interpret them   the major focus will be on systemic infections including listed fish diseases    the course will provide a forum where pre knowledge  experience and examples can be discussed between participants and teachers  and hereby raise the awareness of pitfalls when using the various techniques
