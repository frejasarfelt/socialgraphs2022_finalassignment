the focus of this course is on the advanced skills  tools  and concepts central to successfully building multibody and advanced surface models  the course would cover the standard tools typically present in a feature based parametric cad system  computerized 3d visualizing tools for preparation or presentation material and production drawings will be used  cnc  reverse engineering  3d scanning  and build advanced 3d models from the scanned data  modelling advanced 3d models by use of mathematical equations in the design process  sheet metal design and design of steel structures with sheet metal and weldment modules  introduction to simulation in connection with assignments lectures and practial exercises  approximately half of the time allocated to the course will be used in guided individual tasks and project work  students will work with projects similar to  real life  challenges  which will require the application of advanced techniques the students will obtain a deeper understanding of working with feature based  parametric solid modelling in a cad software  the process based training  emphasizes the processes and procedures one must follow to complete a certain task  case studies  projects  are then performed by the students to ensure deeper understanding and proper application of these processes and procedures  by using an advanced 3d cad software  currently solidworks  faggruppen for mekanisk teknologi  100   maskinteknik  elective course elective course for other study lines too
