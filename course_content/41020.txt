the course is structured into 3 sections  project work and 2 theoretical sections in product manufacturing and problem solving  each amount to 2 5 points of the total 15 points   the project is based on an existing product  i e  an artefact in its context  the artefact as well as the context are taken apart   dissected and analysed with respect to properties  problems  visions and design intentions that appears to be in the product  from the result of the analysis one or more improvement aspects are identified  e g  concerning usability or security  the product is then redesigned based on a  what now if  approach  in the project work it is important to achieve an understanding of how requirements are met  the nature of the product and how the product is materialized   in the theoretical section concerning manufacturing processes there is an overall introduction to different manufacturing flows and the participants work with manufacturing analysis of selected products  the course covers cutting and sheet metal processes  net shape processes  assembly processes  surface technology  microproduction and polymer processes  in the theoretical section concerning creative problem solving a number of themes are combined  each theme includes practical methods  introduction to practice  and explanation of the basis for recognition  the themes encompass goal specification  creative and systematic search for solutions  evaluation  selection and project planning  the theoretical parts of the course are implemented as lectures  methododical exercises and workshop training and are evaluated through the deliverables from the project section project work in teams  lectures  exercises and seminars make the students capable of carrying through a broad spectred multi dimensional analysis of a product and on this basis make a redesign in a way that ensures a reasonable result within limited time  give the student a basic understanding of machines and products with respect to shaping  functionality  properties  product structure  manufacturing and the socio technical context  users  use  everyday life  producers  compettitors  etc    exercise skills in observation  analysis  knowledge seach  description and communication of these relations  give an elementary insight into  and train skills  in problem solving in the form of redesign  give an elementary insight into manufacturing processes and the manufacturing considerations relevant for product design  provide a basis for reflective behaviour in project work concerning ones own participation and the return of the teamwork only for bachelor students from design   innovationthe course is an integrated part of the 2nd semester on the bacheloreducation in design   innovation the course is not applicable to other courses that introduces manufacturing processes  introduction to redesign project work or problem solving
