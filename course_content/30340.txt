the course will describe systems like airport traffic control radar  weather radar  air  and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar  sar   and ice sounding radar  the theory behind the systems is described  and the systems are worked through on a block diagram level  likewise  radiometer systems are introduced  what is radiometry  radiometer principles  imaging radiometer systems  polarimetric radiometer  the course is strongly related to the sensor development taking place at dtu space within airborne sar and radiometer lectures  group work  and project work the course emphasizes system aspects and deals with two important microwave sensors   radar and radiometer systems   used for remote sensing and surveillance  the aim is that the student will eventually be able to perform a proper system analysis and design of radar and radiometer systems for various applications the course is closely related to 30350 remote sensing
