industrial production of small organic biomolecules  metabolites or natural products  as well as proteins using microbial cell factories is estimated to increase dramatically in the coming years  this includes important products such as antibiotics  anticancer agents  smaller proteins  and food ingredients like aroma compounds  pigments  antioxidants and vitamins  other metabolites are toxic to humans and are therefore to be avoided in food and feed  this course will teach the basic principles behind modern methods for analysis of small organic molecules  as well as proteins  especially based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry  the topics will be presented in a mixture of lectures  exercises  group work and presentations lectures  exercises  literature search  group work and student presentationsto give the students an overview of the main types of small organic molecules and proteins that living organisms such as microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize  and how they can be extracted and prepared for chemical analysis  the major objective of the course is to give the students a solid understanding of chromatographic based analytical methods with special emphasis on analysis and detection of both known and unknown compounds by interpretation of mass spectrometric data  the course aims broadly at students studying biotechnology  organic chemistry and pharmatechnology  who want to strengthen their analytical chemical knowledge
