topics will include selections from the following  environmental statistics including uncertainty assessment  parameter estimation and optimisation  sensitivity analysis  and stochastic modelling  environmental models based on coupled ordinary and partial differential equations including modelling of mass and energy conservation and reactive transport  and models of microbial processes  material flow analysis  programming  example cases are taken from the fields environmental fate and effects of chemicals  groundwater flow and transport  and urban water systems  sewer systems  the underlying teaching philosophy is problem based learning  the core of the course consists of a series of tutorials and assignments  which should expose the students to the most important techniques used in environmental modelling  the tutorials and assignments are supported by focussed reading  discussion  and lectures this course aims to provide students the basic knowledge to work with mathematical models and apply them to environmental problems  providing the theoretical basis for subsequent applications in specialization courses  the course has four major elements  i  simple mass balances using big environmental datasets  ii  deterministic modelling using ordinary differential equations  iii  deterministic modelling using partial differential equations and iv  model optimisation  sensitivity analysis and stochastic modelling  the course builds on a series of examples drawn from the field of environmental engineering and employs programming tools and languages  e g   comsol multiphysics  python  to illustrate the general modelling principles  the course will teach students how to integrate observed data with models and apply them to solve environmental problems the course is a mandatory general competence course for the msc in environmental engineering  it is recommended that msc students complete the course in their first year of study  3rd year bsc students are also welcome to take the course
