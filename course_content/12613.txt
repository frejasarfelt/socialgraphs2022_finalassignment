concrete durability is governed by a large number of different physical and chemical processes  often degradation is the result of a complex interplay between several processes  however  transport processes are typically centrally involved  the transport processes both comprise moisture transport and transport of other matters  e g  chlorides in concrete    the course includes a number of practical exercises in the laboratory  where students train techniques that can be used to elaborate the findings of a visual condition survey of a structure  furthermore  the course provides an introduction to the general methodology of maintenance and repair work   during the course  selected repair methods are presented  however  the main focus of the course is to provide the necessary theoretical background for the students to identify transport processes and damage mechanisms in a range of situations  only after identification of the dominant process of deterioration it is possible to initiate optimal repair strategies lectures  guest lectures  written exercises  experimental workthere is no text book for this course  the course literature consists of test standards and scientific papers that are made available via dtu learn the participants will learn about the most common types of concrete degradation and they become capable in identifying different damage mechanisms  moreover  the participants will obtain relevant tools to act upon the findings by suggesting appropriate methods for maintenance and repair course 11563 is a mandatory prerequisite for course 11569  if the student has not passed course 11563 at dtu but has passed a similar course at another university  the student should notify the course responsible  when signing up for course  mail  matah byg dtu dk   in this case the course responsible will decide  if the student can be put on the same footing as students who have passed course 11563   the course is based on experimental work  even though class attendance is not compulsory  it is in reality impossible to complete the course without attending lectures  where instruction in experimental exercises is given  and without active participation in the exercises
