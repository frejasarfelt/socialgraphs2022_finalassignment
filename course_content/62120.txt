the project om 4th semester will have production engineering improvement in a company as the overall theme     the project will include problem formulation  analysis and diagnosis and formulation of possible suggestions to solve the problems and possibly also ways to implement these suggestions    in the course  the students will also write and present one or more studies on a selected specific approved subject   it is important that the problems in the project are both complex and interdisciplinary  analysis and solutions must include aspects from more than one discipline regarding operations management  technology  economy  and information technology  operations management aspects must always be included project work in small groups with 4 to 5 students  each group will have a process supervisor assigned and may also discuss specific problems with other teachers as well notes will be distributed  supplementary literature  serope kalpakjian  manufacturing engineering and technology  fourth edition   roberta s  russell and b  w  taylor iii  operations management  fourth edition to give the students a solid knowledge of methods used in solving manufacturing engineering problems  and to give them practical experience in using such methods in a specific project in a company    the project build upon the skills and competences gained from the projects in 1 3  semester  and all mandatory courses in the production engineering education  the use of these skills and competences are integrated in a problem based context    in relation to methods this project forms the basis for a later final project in a company normally the students themselves will contact a company and make appointment about a project when it is approved by the study programme  sometimes however  the study programme will suggest projects   the course is highly related to 62119  scientific theory and manufacturing engineering methods  this course include relevant methods
