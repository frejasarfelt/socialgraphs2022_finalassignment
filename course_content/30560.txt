the content of the course includes earth s gravity field  measurement of gravity on land and from aircraft and satellites  computation of the geoid  as well as satellites and their behaviour in the gravity field  supplemented by elements from statistics and estimation lectures and exercises the earth s gravity field varies from location to location depending on the composition of the materials in the subsurface  these variations impact the shape of the earth and cause the water in the oceans not to coincide with a simple surface  the geoid is an equipotential surface for gravity describing the zero level surface  on land  the geoid is needed to compute heights from satellite positioning    the goal of the course is to provide the students with knowledge about the mathematical models and methodology used for describing the earth s shape and gravity field
