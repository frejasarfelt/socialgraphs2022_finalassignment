  secure system design   cyber security framework  nist    cyber riscs and response   documentation of securitywhen the company must secure data in transit and storage  it is important to choose a safe and sufficiently fast cryptographic algorithm  in order to make a sensible choice  it is necessary to know the most commonly used algorithms  it is also important to create a secure network and databases  it is also necessary to work with strategic planning in cyber security  the course provides an overview of secure network architecture and data storage as well as the most commonly used security algorithms  the course introduces to symmetric and asymmetric algorithms and ecc  elliptic curve cryptography   in addition  the course reviews hash algorithms and the use of digital signatures  the course covers the most commonly used security protocols  diffie hellman key distribution  kereberos  x 509  pgp ssl tls   the course also contains implementation of backup systems and use of honeypots  the course uses cybersecurity framework from nist  this framework is used to identify security risks and create protection strategies as well as strategies to detect cyber security events in the system
