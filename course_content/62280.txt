denmark s drinking water supply is covered by groundwater  throughout the country  there is focus on developing new methods for securing good water quality for supply  in this course you will learn about the design of waterworks and you will learn about cleaning up contaminated sites and designing remediation solutions  in the course you will also learn how to protect the groundwater resource  seen in the context of the the 17 global goals for sustaniable development  the whole water cycle and in relation to legislation on water planning   processes at the water plant  the interior design and technologies  pumping for water abstraction and pumping for water distribution  the influence of climate change and rainwater removal on the groundwater resource and water balance  remediation methods for protection of groundwater and indoor climate  groundwater protection and action plans  including risk assessment of polluted site for the purpose of prioritization of remediation methods  water abstraction  chemistry and water quality as well as water treatment to ensure drinking water quality  legislation and plans that support the protection of groundwater  the eu water framework directive and related danish legislations  course work including groundwater protection  action plans and remediation  and including legislation  water plant and water treatment student presentations in groups  lectures and discussions  teaching also by external professionals and excursions  course projects are carried out in groups of 3   4 students  supervisors contribute to the group formation for integrating exchange students and danish students vandforsyning  nyt teknisk forlag  latest edition reports and recommendations from the danish environmental protection agency  mst dk legislation  directives ect  retsinfo dk reports and recommendations from danish regions  environment and resources  for exchange students is recommended  water resources engineering  wiley water works engineering  planning  design and operation  prentice hall ptr introduction to environmental engineering and science  pearson international edition soil and water conservation for productivity and environmental protection  pearson education the us environmental protection agency epa govthe natural drainage system  e g  streams  lakes and fjords  affects the quality of groundwater  which is the basis for water treatment at the water plant  at the same time  groundwater recharge is affected by climate change and the way  we handle rainwater and rainwater runoff  one of the main objectives of the course is therefore to acquire knowledge and understanding of water balance and the hydrological cycle  another main objective is to acquire knowledge about how environmental legislation leads to action plans and remediation to protect our groundwater resources both qualitatively and quantitatively  it is also important that the student acquires knowledge of technologies used in water treatment and that the student acquires competencies in the design of water plant and of remediation technologies science group  mobility  environment and infrastructure building and civil engineering  elective course arctic civil engineering  elective coursegeus  national well database jagg  risc assessment of soil evaporation  gas and ground water rems remediation strategy for soil and groundwater pollution langelier saturation index calculator
