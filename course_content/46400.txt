the course will present an introduction to theory and methods for the experimental determination of wind characteristics  remote sensing of wind speed  wind turbine power performance  mechanical loads and vibrations together with the assessment of noise emission  these topics will be presented in relation to the relevant iec standards  the lectures are combined with exercises based on real wind turbine measurements  calibration of sensors and recording of real time data from a wind turbine sited at ris√∏ campus  roskilde  this wind turbine  which will be visited during the course  is fully instrumented for load and power measurements lectures  exercises and lab  workto give an overview of measurement techniques used in and around wind turbines if more than 32 have signed up for the course 1st priority is given to students at the m sc  in wind energy  all assignments need to be submitted and accepted before the examination
