the course will provide insights in advanced functional programming topics and their use in concrete applications  theoretical topics will be covered  they will have a role in program constructions inspired by practical and or research oriented problems   the course is centered around 2 3 mini projects  a mini project is introduced through lectures and possibly exercises  a mini project results in a product in the form of a program and a mini report   the contents may change on a yearly basis  examples of themes are  resource planning  parallel gathering of information  reactive programs  apps for mobile phones  domain specific languages  decision procedures  interpreters  compilers  analysis tools  monadic programming lectures and exercise classes  independent project work to enable that the participants can apply functional programming in the solution of practical as well as more theoretical problems the course is intended as a extension of 02157 functional programming that should allow an effective use of functional programming in connection with courses and projects at the m sc  programme in computer science and engineering  for instance within program analysis  verification  and analysis tools for embedded systems
