the design and mode of operation of solar collectors  heat storages and solar heating systems  heat balance and efficiency factors of solar collectors  calculation and test of the efficiency of solar collectors  thermal behaviour of heat storages  calculation of temperatures in heat storages  calculation and optimization of solar heating systems and exposition of conditions about the construction and design of these  both individual and collective solar heating systems including seasonal heat storages are treated lectures and exercisesto inform the participants of the fundamental mode of operation of solar heating systems and give them knowledge of the problems about the practical design of solar collectors and solar heating systems  this provides the necessary background for being able to calculate and dimension solar heating systems and connect these with traditional heating systems for domestic hot water and space heating
