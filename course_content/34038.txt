the students will be organized in groups as they select an optical designproject  alternative design projects can be suggested by students and planned on forehand with the supervisor  each group outlines one or two solutions to the problem  then the solutions will be simulated or evaluated with zemax and maybe minor experiments can be included as well  the groups will present and discus progress and solutions together  the students will get a license to zemax during the course project work in groupsthis course is project orientated  and provides the students an option to use the skills  they have learned during the introduction courses in optics and photonics  and to evaluate optimize their solutions with optical design and simulation tools such as zemax
