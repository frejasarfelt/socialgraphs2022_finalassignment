lectures  discussions in groups  and laboratory projects will combine to cover a broad range of subjects  e g  main type catalysts and catalytic effects  preparation methods  reaction kinetics  process design  characterization techniques and structure and reactivity of model catalysts and industrial catalysts  furthermore  a number of concepts of green and sustainable chemistry will be dealt with in relation to environmentally benign energy and chemicals production  e g  multi phase catalysis  life cycle assessment and alternative reaction media  the practical projects in the course will to some extent be part of the research performed at the department of chemistry where the students are expected to search the relevant literature lectures  work in groups  laboratory exercises  and poster report  the course comprise projects where you will work independently on synthesis  characterization and test of catalysts for production of chemicals and flue gas cleaning  the projects are concluded with dissemination of results an interdisciplinary course which will give students a fundamental understanding of various main type catalysts  and knowledge of principles and methodologies applicable to obtain ressource effecient and sustainable chemical reactions  the student should be able to synthesize different main type catalysts  characterize the structure of the materials on the nanometer scale and test the materials for catalytic activity  thus allowing them to establish structure performance relationships  furthermore  it is expected that the student will be able to assess the sustainability of catalytic processes after completing the course
