after a general introduktion to high voltage engineering will methods for the calculation and control of electric fields in electric apparatus be covered  including numeric field calculations  fem  for correct design of insulation systems   the basic mechanisms in connection with the electric strength of gasses  liquids and solid dielectric media are studied  lightning and lightning protection will be treated and illustrated by means of examples  furthermore  laboratory techniques for the generation of high voltages with the associated measurement techniques are treated   the topics are studied in further detail under the group work and laboratory exercises lectures  compulsory laboratory exercises and solving of minor problems in groups kreuger   industrial high voltage   delft university press  j  holb√∏ll   partial discharges  nature and detection the course is addressed to students who want a basic knowledge about high voltage engineering  the teaching is directed towards an understanding of important electric phenomena  the understanding of which is necessary for correct design and construction of high voltage components and other apparatus with high electrical fields   lectures and experimental laboratory exercises are combined with several calculations and numerical simulations to give insight into the special test  measurement and calculation methods that are used within high voltage engineering  where high voltages and currents occur over a broad frequency range  the students will be able to evaluate different types of insulation materials used in apparatus with high electrical field strengths and where aging phenomena due to electrical and thermal stresses are important at the first lecture groups will be formed  no show no mail the first day will be treated as resignation from the course  the supplementary registration period ends at the second day  where the mandatory group exercises start
