the course consists of lectures and tutorials exercises  all theoretical aspects will be supported by practical sessions consisting of both exercises and software tests   the topics presented are       formalizations and graphical representations of business processes      extraction of data for process mining purposes      simulation of models for process mining purposes      algorithms for control flow discovery      4 quality dimensions of process mining      algorithms for conformance checkinglectures  group work and student presentations the aim of the course is to enable the students to understand and create formal representation of business processes  e g   petri net  and to understand the purpose and potential of process mining  the students will be able to understand and analyze the differences among the state of the art process mining techniques and which are the ideal application conditions for each of them  additionally  the students will be able to formulate relevant and meaningful questions  useful to analyze behavioral aspect of the process and to test these hypotheses on event logs  finally  students will be able to independently extract and analyze event logs with commercial and open source process mining tools available in order to answer process related questions and test hypotheses
