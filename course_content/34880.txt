mechanisms for the generation of vibration and sound in structures  simple resonators and models for damping mechanisms  concepts of mobility and mechanical impedance  vibro acoustic measurement techniques  introduction to applied signal analysis  spectral analysis  estimation of transfer functions  etc   the generation of vibration and sound waves in solids and structures  structureborne sound   longitudinal waves and bending waves in beams and plates  analytical and statistical methods for calculating structureborne sound and transmission in complex structures  vibration isolation  attenuation and damping of structureborne sound in equipment and machinery  sound radiation from vibrating structures  plates  cylinders  cabinets  etc   control and damping of vibration and sound radiation  principles for altering the transmission and radiation properties of structures lectures  compulsary mini projects and experimental excercises  problem solving and review of written exercises structure borne sound is the field of acoustics that deals with the generation and propagation of vibrations and forces in solid bodies and structures  as well as sound radiation of these structures  vibration and wave motions in structures like beams and plates are essential   by introducing the principles and laws governing the generation  transmission and radiation of structure borne sound  it is the purpose of the course to enable the student to  a  analyse vibro acoustic systems  e g   technical noise and vibration problems  b  make practical proposals for reducing structure borne noise in cabinets  machines  vehicles  buildings  etc   and c  apply advanced measurement techniques for verifying theoretical calculations the course is aimed at students who  having followed a basic course in acoustics  wish for a more advanced understanding of sound and vibration  its generation  propagation and attenuation  the course is a natural introduction to a master thesis work in acoustic technology and or camm   centre for acoustic mechanical microsystems  it is good to have taken 31240 and 31260 beforehand   e learning is used in the form of video streamed podcast lectures  quizzes etc  and digital exam this is the old dtu elektro course 31270 moved to the new institute
