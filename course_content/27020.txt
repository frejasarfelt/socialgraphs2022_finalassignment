this course will introduce fundamental principles of biology and biotechnology that relate to a wide variety of disciplines  the course will introduce the chemical basis for life and its relation to biochemistry and enzymes  dna is introduced as the universal information carrying molecule of life  and how biology converts sequence information through the processes of replication  transcription and translation into chemical functionality  course content will consist of lectures  discussions  exercises and group work  content will be structured in three blocks  block 1 will introduce the fundamental principles and applications of molecular biology  the phenomenon of evolution  some basic notions of ecology and the important role that large data sets play in modern biology  weeks 1 6  corresponds to module 1    in block 2  weeks 7 10   participants will be able to choose between three modules  that have different focus  each module will be co organised by at least 2 different departments  the broad focus areas of the three modules are biosensing  module 2   biomimetics and biomaterials  module 3  and simulations and control of biological systems  module 4   block 3 will consist of a group project incorporating themes from blocks 1 and 2  the project will be carried out in interdisciplinary groups of 4 5 students lectures  exercises and group workthe recent technological advances have created the foundation for engineering biological systems in order to address a wide variety of societal challenges and provide sustainable solutions for the health  food  environment and energy sectors  this course is intended to provide all bsc students with an introduction to biological principles and an understanding of the fundamental technologies underlying cross disciplinary applications of biology in all engineering areas
