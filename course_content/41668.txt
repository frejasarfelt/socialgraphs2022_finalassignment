the course is taught in three modules with each of duration of one week focused on 1  thermodynamic calculations  2  linear programming and 3  monte carlo simulations  at the end of each module  the students will present the results of a small project to the teachers and the other students  the weekly projects will focus on application of the simulation methods of the module to a materials science problem  the course introduces the mentioned simulation techniques and the students will implement these to address specific problems of complex phase equilibria  deformation induced evolution of crystallographic texture and mechanical properties  and microstructural evolution during recrystallization and grain growth  the simulations will be compared to real microstructures three modules of one week duration  each consisting of lectures  simulation exercises and project work the student will obtain an understanding of basic principles behind numerical simulations of microstructure evolution in crystalline materials  primarily metals  induced by chemical  mechanical and thermal external loads  including the associated changes in material properties in 2023 the course is moved from june to january
