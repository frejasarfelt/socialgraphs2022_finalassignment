different computational materials simulation methods will be divided into three main topics each being discussed during four weeks  the following methods will be introduced in the course   1  thermodynamic calculations and diffusion simulations   2  phase field and monte carlo simulations  and  3  property modelling by homogenization and localization using the finite element method  within each 4 week period  the students will first learn about the different simulation tools via lectures and small exercises  then a group project will be introduced for each topic  the students will apply the simulation methods to a materials science problem  the students will utilize the simulation tools to address specific problems of complex phase equilibria  diffusion induced phase transformation  microstructural evolution during interdiffusion  recrystallization and grain growth and mechanical properties  the simulated microstructure will be compared with real microstructures  the students will further predict materials properties based on the simulated microstructures  at the end of each 4 week period  the students will present the results of the project in the form of a group presentation to the teachers and the other students the course will contain three main topics discussing different materials simulation methods  the course will be based on lectures  simulation exercises and project work in groups course materials will be made available online during the course in this course  the student will obtain an understanding of basic principles behind numerical simulations of microstructure evolution in crystalline materials  oxides and metals  induced by chemical  mechanical or thermal external loads  including the associated changes in material properties  such as microstructure  electrical and thermal conductivity  elasticity or plasticity  etc  this course gives an introduction to various materials simulation methods from micro to macro scale and is thus priming the students who wish to go deeper into computer simulation and or design of structural or functional materials in later courses are you interested in learning computer simulations to understand materials systems and to drive future technology and innovation in materials science and engineering  if so  this is the course for you
