the theoretical background from introduction to operations research is supplemented by introducing a standard program modelling system for formulating and solving mathematical models  i e  both linear programming models and integer linear programming models  the first 7 9 days of the course are used to introduce the modelling language  the rest of the course is the used to model and solve a number of semi realistic optimisation problems lectures and project work course notesto enable students to solve large operations research problems using mathematical models and standard software  this entails formulating a mathematical optimization model  using standard modelling language julia jump and solvers to solve the model  evaluate alternatives  and finally describe results and conclusions in a report  since the various standard programs for mathematical modelling are rather similar  the knowledge gained is not restricted to the software employed here attendance for the first lecture on 2 1 22 at 9 00 is required note  to participate in the course  the student has to register on the second day of the course the tuesday 3 1 2022 in person at either richard lusby or thomas stidsen  students who have not registered in person the 3 1  will not be allowed to follow and complete the course  notice  to have plane tickets with arrival after 3 1 is not an acceptable excuse   note   registration to the course is guaranteed during the regular registration period which ends 1 12 2021  registration during the supplementary registration period will be allowed as long as there is space in the auditorium  once the auditorium capacity is exceeded the registration will close and will not open again
