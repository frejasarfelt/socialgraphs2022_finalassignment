cell biology is the integration of molecular biology with biochemistry and physiology explaining how the living cell grows  divides and evolves  in agreement with this view  cell biology focuses on design  organization and regulation at the whole cell level  because the field is integrative  we will rely heavily on biochemical knowledge of enzymes and pathways  as well as on knowledge from molecular genetics  molecular biology and systems descriptions of regulatory networks  cell biology provides much of the scientific basis behind systems biology   two recurrent motifs will be highlighted throughout the course    	understanding the interconnectedness of physiological  organizational and regulatory processes within the cell and  	devising strategies to intervene in these complex processes to manipulate an organism for scientific  biotechnological or medical purposes lectures and problem solvingthe course will provide the student with competences in the organization and regulation of prokaryotic cell structure and metabolism  these competences will enable the student to describe and explain the function of regulatory and organizational networks  and to predict the results of genetic changes affecting the networks  moreover  the student will be able to suggest novel designs within synthetic biology
