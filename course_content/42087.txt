this course brings together specific design methods as well as the design process through reflective practice in the beginning of the course a design case will be presented  the students will form groups in which they will address the brief by   1 	designing a process utilising a range of design methods  adapted to the given case   2 	execute the design task by applying  reflecting on  and improving design methods  practices  and process  the students will be evaluated on their ability to reflect on and improve their use of methods and process   in order to support this  the students are taught a range of reflective practices and approaches to design methods based on both technical and behavioural theory  for example  core topics will include reflective practice  the theory of inventive problem solving  and behavioural design design for behaviour change  furthermore  the students are taught how to fit the methods together and critically reflect on and improve both the methods and the overall process project work in teams  lectures  assignments  presentations and seminars  the course aims to equip students for real world engineering design problems where one design method is often insufficient to adequately address a problem  the course has been specifically designed to avoid overlap with the design and innovation bachelor program  it adds new skills  tools and methods relevant to design and innovation as well as other students interested in this area  these take two main forms  synthesising and applying multiple design methods in a cohesive process  understanding  applying and reflecting on design methods   the application  synthesis  reflection on  and modification of a wide range of design methods prepares the student to not only react effectively to complex changing problems but also to effectively plan  manage and improve the overall process  the course brings together a student s existing and new design knowledge in order to tackle a real world design challenge the course is conducted in english the course is conducted in english
