a mathematical model is a set of equations describing the behaviour of a real system  and how the behaviour may be influenced by external stimuli  a mathematical model enables the engineer to design a process  to optimize designs  and to control the resulting working process  treatment of sustainability considerations in a process technology context often requires extensive use of models   the formulation of a mathematical model is based on the following principal elements  conservation of mass and energy  known relations between transport rates and physico chemical conditions  flow  diffusion  conduction  mass and heat transfer   and knowledge about the concentration and temperature dependence of the rates of the involved chemical reactions   based on examples the course covers    choice of control volume    steady and non steady state differential mass and energy balances    formulation of boundary conditions through balance equations    fluxes    transport through variable control volume surfaces    linearization and stability  with the intent of exploring the interaction between different transport mechanisms as well as between chemical reaction and transport of mass and heat lectures  problem solving sessions and homework problems  a midterm problem with report  usually  the midterm problem  placed in the period from mid march to mid april  lasts 2 3 weeks with concurrent teaching activities  exact period may vary textbook  binay k  dutta  mathematicical methods in chemical and biological engineering  crc press  2017  isbn 978 1 4822 1038 5to enable the students to formulate and solve mathematical models for chemical systems in chemical and biotechnological process equipment the course is one of three important chemical engineering prerequisites  28020  28140  28160  for admission to msc studies in chemical and biochemical engineering  in this context  bachelor studies in chemistry and technology should preferably in addition include the courses 28221  28121 28125  and 28150
