the course is given partly as theoretical lectures and partly as computer exercises using ansys mechanical apdl  ansys parametric design language   the stiffness method is taken as a starting point to introduce the finite element method  fem   topics related to the choice of element types  mesh development  equation solving  introducing boundary conditions  and result presentation are in focus  the exercises guide the student through the main steps of building the analysis model  creating meshes  applying boundary conditions  solution and result presentation for a range of problems  the course prepares the students to conduct finite element analyses through the development of own text based apdl input files for ansys mechanical apdl  during the three weeks period in january a larger project work is performed lectures  exercises with tutorials and own text based input files  apdl  as well as project work  the project work are performed in groups of three persons  for the reports students have to declare which parts of the work each group member is responsible for basic assessments with concerning strength  stress  weight  vibration  fatigue  and life cycle of various parts of machinery  shell  and beam like structures  medico devices   life science   biomechanical components  etc  all require modern computer based simulations  industry 4 0    furthermore  for setting up digital twins with the purpose of optimization  green solutions and societal impact with increased health it is necessary to be able to perform reliable numerical analyses  un goals     the course gives the student an understanding of the basic theoretical background for such numerical assessments by finite element analyses  fea   using a commercial finite element program the student will be able to conduct analyses in 2d and 3d  it is emphasized that the student obtains an understanding of the possibilities and restrictions associated with the application of commercial finite element programs
