the course will focus on the understanding of the structural response and failure of composite structures when exposed to loading  this will be done by providing the students with practical and computational methods to analyze and design these structures  focus will partly be on the design of wind turbine blades  but the obtained knowledge can be applied to other types of composite structures   the course content is equally distributed between theoretical methods for analysis and the practical application of these methods in design  the following theoretical topics will be covered during this course     overview of composite science and technology  materials  manufacturing  applications      classical laminate theory  clt      failure analysis  failure criteria  progressive damage failure analysis  buckling  fatigue      beam and plate theory for monolithic fiber reinforced composites     beam and plate theory for sandwich structures     finite element analysis  fea  of composite structures  formulation  modeling technology      design and analysis of composite structures   understanding and application of the above topics is achieved through practical exercises in design and failure of composite and sandwich components  fea and programming in matlab or similar  lectures  exercises and possible company visitcomposite materials are increasingly being used in the design of advanced and lightweight structures  such as wind turbine blades  airplanes  land vehicles  marine and space structures   the course aims to provide students with the fundamental knowledge and necessary tools for designing and analyzing components and large structures made of lightweight composite materials
