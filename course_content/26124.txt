the concepts of coordination chemistry are introduced  including hard soft acid bases  isomerism  crystal field theory  ligand field and molecular orbital theory  on this basis  the structural  thermodynamic  kinetic  spectral  and magnetic properties of transition metal compounds are explained  the chemistry of selected transition metals and the catalytic and bioinorganic aspects of coordination chemistry are treated lectures  highlight of examples and exercises weller overton rourke armstrong inorganic chemistry  oxford university press latest editionto give insight into general  modern coordination chemistry  both knowledge of the theory and experimental methods within the field  the course will develop a general chemical understanding based on electronic structure  which will also be useful within other fields of importance in areas where metal ions play a role  for example biochemistry  catalysis  analytical chemistry and environmental chemistry
