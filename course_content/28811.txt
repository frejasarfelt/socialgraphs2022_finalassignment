first day of the course is an elementary introduction to polymer properties  the second day each group will visit an industrial company and here recieve a problem  which is related to real life  the groups will plan and delegate their own experimental work necessary to solve the problem  prerequisites for the individual problems may vary to suit the profiles of individual students  it is expected that approximately half of the course time is spent using laboratory equipment at the danish polymer centre  which includes polymers synthesis  determination of molar mass  melting temperatures  glass transitions and identification of polymer types  as well as mechanical testing  on the last but one day a poster in powerpoint format is handed in  on the last day the groups give oral presentations  this ensures that course participants will obtain a broad image of the polymer field project work in groups  as a start each group visits a company with a polymer based production  preparation of a poster and presentation of the project work in plenum concludes the course work the overall goals of the course are to give the students an introduction to the polymer related area   starting with a company visit and succeeded by project work  through practical investigations that are employed in industry and are of significance for preparation and development of polymeric products  the experimental methods are enlightened and rehearsed
