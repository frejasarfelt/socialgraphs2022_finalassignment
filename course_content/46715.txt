a number of fundamental topics relevant for the power system and its components will be treated  transients occur under lightning and under switching processes in the grid  including closing and breaking actions  calculation of overvoltages requires application of high frequent component equivalents based on lumped circuits  as well as including transmission line models with distributed parameters  in particular will be treated cables  breakers and transformers in different configurations  also covered are calculation of overvoltages in overhead line systems under lightning  the system s response and resistance against these transients are investigated by means of insulation coordination  the numerical tool mainly used is pscad lectures and group work  a number of mandatory problems have to be solved incl  a larger simulation assignment by means of a numerical time domain tool  approval of the solutions is required for passing the course to give a solid background for understanding and calculation of the generation and characteristics of electrical transients in selected electric power systems  also knowledge will be achieved within component s high frequent equivalents and the influence of transients on these components and on the grid performance  the students will become familiar with pscad as numerical tool for time domain simulations and a number of other methods used in power engineering at the first lecture groups will be formed  no show no mail the first day will be treated as resignation from the course  the supplementary registration period ends at the third day  where the group project starts
