illustration of typical material behavior within civil engineering structural problems to set up a continuum mechanical description  material models for plasticity   yield criteria  plastic strain increments  hardening  material models for time dependent materials  implementation of the models in a matlab based finite element program for a simple structure with relevant solution algorithms  fracture mechanical modeling of cracks  application of a commercial fe software to analyse the application of non linear materials and the assessment of the results lectures and exercises materials like steel  wood and concrete  often used in civil engineering  exhibits a non linear behaviour at high load levels  the course provides an continuum mechanical introduction to such material behavior with focus on numerical implementation and application  the objective is to provide the students with enough knowledge to select  understand and apply given material models used for computer simulations in civil engineering structures
