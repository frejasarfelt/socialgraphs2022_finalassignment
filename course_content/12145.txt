environmental issues are often related to human health and impacts on natural systems  i e  ecosystems   in this course we will study what terrestrial ecosystems are and how they work  to be able to understand the background of environmental regulations and the potential of ecosystems to solve societal problems  the course addresses specifically the un sdg  15 life on land and 13 climate action    the focus of the course will be mainly on soils  vegetation and ecosystem   atmosphere interactions  topics include  ecosystem structure  soil characteristics  energy and water cycling  plant production  soil organic matter  organisms and ecosystem processes  ecosystem modeling  biogeochemical cycles  global change  ecosystem services  ecosystem resilience  and environmental impact of perturbations    two practical exercises are included  soil sampling and analysis  and measurements of plant atmosphere relations lectures  theoretical and practical exercises√•gren  g i  and andersson  f o   terrestrial ecosystem ecology   principles and applications  cambridge university press  2012  notes manuals for practical exercises the principle goal of the course is that engineering students obtain a generic scientific understanding of the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems  this enables them to evaluate how ecosystem provide services for the human society and how vulnerable ecosystems are to perturbation by anthropogenic activities  emphasis will be given to specific topics of high relevance to environmental engineering such as soil properties  bioproduction  biogeochemical cycles  bio monitoring   bio remediation  ecological engineering and impact of human activities such as air pollution and land use change advanced course technological specialisation course
