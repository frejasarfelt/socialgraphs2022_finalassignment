the course covers a range of subjects in the field of biomaterials science and engineering  areas are defined in collaboration with the students  and the teacher will ensure broadness in the subjects  the course will include training in comprehensive literature search  as well as a number of tutorials on broadly applicable methods and tools in biomaterials science and engineering  the specific content of the course changes from semester to semester depending on the teachers and guests participating in the course and on the interests of the participating students  students will be required to prepare themselves for each of the presentations by reading background material the course goal is to give knowledge about subjects in and to introduce critical reading of the research literature in biomaterials science and engineering  i e  the synthesis  processing  analysis  and application of materials for in vitro and in vivo biological use  and give the participants presentation training  this is accomplished by reading papers presented by the other participants and by presenting papers  a final report on a literature study is prepared and peer reviewed by another course participant and finally handed in at the end of the course
