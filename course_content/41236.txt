the course consits of lectures and exercises  the aim of the exercises is to practice the methods of caluculation  the folllowing main topics are treated in the course   1  reaction and section forces for plane beam and frame structures with internal hinges   2  deformations for plane beam and frame structures with internal hinges   3  the notion of stress and deformation of elastic materials   4  the generalized hooke s law   5  planar yield conditions  von mises og tresca    6  bi axial bending of beams with single  and double symmetric cross sections  the navier stress distribution   7  shear stresses in elastic beams  the grasshof formula   8  homogeneous torsion of elastic beams with open or closed cross sections lectures and exercisessteen krenk   jan h√∏gsberg   statics and mechanics of structures   springer  2013 the goal of the course is to give a basic understanding of how structures work  and provide knowledge of methods for analysis and design of simple structures  the course provides the basis for courses in structural design and more advanced theory of structural elements    the main theme of the course are beams and their role in statically determinate beam and frame structures  central elements of the course are  determination of reactions  internal forces and moments and beam deflections for given loads og boundary conditions  in addition to the notion of stress  as well as simple stress states associated with extension  bending and torsion of beams  in addition the course deals with continuum mechanics subjects such as stress and strain analysis  as well as elastic and yielding properties of isotropic structural materials  the theory is practiced and illustrated through relevant exercises
