the first task to be solved in this course is focused on studying the decomposition of h2o2  which has an important application in water treatment   you will use a combination of experimental techniques as well as density functional theory and kinetic modelling towards mechanistic understanding  establishing activity descriptors  and devising strategies towards the rational design for catalysts for this process      the second task will build upon the general concepts learned in the first  each team will research a specific catalytic process  the activity descriptors  possible controversies in the literature  and their perspectives on strategies for catalyst design     interdisciplinary student teams will be formed with special consideration for the required skills competencies needed for the problem problem based team projects   explore the mechanism and activity descriptors for h2o2 decomposition using theoretical simulations and experimental techniques  devise strategies towards the rational design of better catalysts for this process  research project on a specific catalytic process  which explores the mechanism  activity descriptors  catalyst structural characterization  and catalyst design strategies to learn basic principles and applications of heterogeneous catalysis and to be immersed in project work in teams this course is only available for students enrolled on the bachelor study line in general engineering
