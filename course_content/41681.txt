the course treats materials generally with main emphasis on metals  polymers  ceramics  and composites are presented complementary  focus is on the relation between manufacturing and processing of materials  their resulting internal structure and their mechanical properties and performance  the course contains     atomic bonds  crystal structures  lattice defects  amorphous and semi crystalline materials   phase diagrams  interpretation of these and calculation of mass fractions  phase equilibria  phase transformations and heat treatment of steel   changes in the microstructure of materials due to mechanical and thermal load   mechanical properties  testing and methods of changing the strength of metals  polymers and ceramics   cracks  fatigue failure  and protection against   introduction to material database software   method of selection of materials as well as application of a material indexthe teaching is based on active participation of students in group work  there will be introductory and summing up lectures  project work and presentations the course provides a broad and general knowledge of materials  the course aims to give an understanding of how different materials are and what these differences mean for the mechanical properties and applications of the materials  the course highlights the relationship between the microstructure of the materials and their mechanical properties and provides insight into ways to change them  insight will be gained into methods to select the most suitable materials for a given application and to meet given requirements and demands for a particular component  including using a material data base the course includes project work with preparation of presentations which contribute to the final grade and must be presented orally
