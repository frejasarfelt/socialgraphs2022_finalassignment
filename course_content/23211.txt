the student will in the learning process understand and theoretically apply processes  e g  enzymatically  liquid liquid and solid liquid extraction  filtering  drying etc   to different raw materials biomasses in order to obtain different new ingredients of higher value such as proteins  polysaccharides  pigments  vitamins and polyphenols in a sustainable manner  the raw materials and wastes are case studies such as algae  fish side streams  potato waste  furthermore  the students will briefly learn about the functions of the ingredients such as emulsifiers  antioxidants  colouring agents etc  the teaching will be a mix of active learning by presentations  work in small teams  three by three  for preparing posters of concepts for each case  student presentations and discussions  in order to form future food engineers lectures  team work for poster preparation  presentation and feedback to co studentsthe overall aim of this course is to give a theoretical background within production of food ingredients with a specific focus on adding value to raw materials and waste side streams for production of new food ingredients and supplements in a sustainable manner  cases will be used as illustrations of applied tehcnologies  production and utilization concepts  the aim is also to give an introductory background on the quality and functionality of the ingredients and their utilization technological specialization course food technology
