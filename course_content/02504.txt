methods covered in the course are based on a combination of mathematics  statistics and machine learning  all applied to images from a perspective camera  students are introduced to theoretic aspects of computer vision methods and obtain practical experience by carrying out exercises  where the methods are implemented in computer programs  finally  the student will be planning  working on  and presenting a mini project within computer vision  it is expected that students participating in this course have experience in programming in e g  matlab or python and experience with fundamental topics and concepts from image analysis lectures  exercises  and projekt workwe will use lecture notes and scientific articles this course covers core topics in computer vision including 3d geometry and surface reconstruction for obtaining information from images obtained from a perspective camera  computer vision methods are core to a range of applications including digital entertainment  mapping  visual sensors in industrial application  robot navigation  and many others  the course aims at providing students a combined theoretical and practical understanding of how computer vision problems are solved
