starting from maxwell s equations  the fundamental principles for localization and manipulation of light are established  dielectric waveguides  their geometries and mutual coupling  will be discussed  furthermore  plasmonic waveguides and metallic waveguides for thz radiation are introduced  the course gives an introduction to the building blocks of optical circuits  such as passive waveguides  bragg gratings and couplers  microstructured optical fibers and their bandgap effects are also introduced  the course contains excursions to danish companies  thus giving a good impression of the ongoing activities within the field to establish a solid understanding of the physical and technological background for optical waveguides and components for the control of a broad spectrum of light  from the visible to thz frequencies  optical circuits are expected to become of great importance for future engineers within areas such as telecommunication  sensors and computer architecture  optical fibers already play a crucial role within long distance signal transmission  and are increasingly used as sensors  in laser systems  and for signal processing  this course gives a thorough understanding of optical fibers  an introduction to integrated optical and plasmonic circuits  and a discussion of elementary thz technology  the course constitutes a solid platform for further work  e g  masters projects  within these fields
