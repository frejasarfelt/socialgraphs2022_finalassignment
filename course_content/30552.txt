the course will focus on the space geodetic observations utilized for positioning and for defining the basic reference frames for mapping and navigation  how to compute positions and how to obtain information about continental drift and crustal deformations   the course will also focus on satellite altimetry and its use for mapping the topography of the earth and monitoring changes in sea level  glaciers and ice sheets  and in land water bodies  finally  the course will focus on satellite gravimetry missions and on how these satellite missions are used for measuring the earth s gravity field  some examples of how satellite gravimetry may be used for monitoring mass movements will be explained   exercises are carried out using matlab lectures and exercisesg√ºnter seeber  satellite geodesy  foundations  methods  and applications accurate mapping and monitoring of changes  e g   inland topography  sea level and ice sheets  highly rely on the global geodetic observing system  ggos   compromising various space geodetic techniques such as gnss and earth observation  the course aims to provide a thorough overview of space based geodetic technologies  including instrumentation  observation techniques  models  methods and monitoring systems to define and maintain the geodetic reference frames to measure precise positions and map the shape and gravity field of the earth the course covers basic aspects of satellite geodesy and elements from the former courses 30550 satellite based positioning and 30200 measurement technologies in earth and space physics the course is recommended for the first semester of the master program earth and space physics and engineering and is mandatory for the program s study line  mapping and navigation   the course is a prerequisite for 30554 global navigation satellite systems  the course does not deal with hardware  the course does not include data collection or fieldwork
