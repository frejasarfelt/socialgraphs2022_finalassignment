the course is structured to provide the students with an overview of the many different beneficial uses of bacteria and the molecular and physiological mechanisms that underlies these applications  the course is focused both on novel break through technologies in molecular and synthetic biology  and on methods to utilize the bacterial biodiversity found in nature  overall  the course will provide the students with competences that allow them to design  develop  and improve bacterial systems for biotechnological applications lectures  journal club presentations and discussions of scientific papers reviews and original scientific papersthe course aims to provide the students with competences in areas where bacteria are used in biotechnology  these competences will enable the students to describe the breath of biotechnology applications that are based on bacterial systems  to explain the recent technological advances in molecular and synthetic biology within the field  and to design  control and optimize bacterial cell factories  probiotic strains  and microbial communities
