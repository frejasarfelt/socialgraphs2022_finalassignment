in the beginning of the course  the students are taught a little about project work and development models for engineered products  a project or subproject is then chosen and the students are divided into groups of 2 6 students according to the project choice  the groups must prepare a detailed project specification and then a written description of the project  the process is divided into stages each followed by a review allowing to proceed to the next stage  the project specification and descriptions are handed in as a report which must be approved before the start of the 3 week period  during the 3 week period the implementation and testing are carried out and the final report is written  the project must be presented orally the last day of the 3 week period  the projects to be done may be defined in one or more of the following fields    optical or wireless communication systems   signal processing in communication systems   coding and modulation   network architecture and network elements lectures and project work in groups of 2 6 students  project work in the 3 week period to train the participants in synthesis of system elements by carrying out an engineering project in telecommunication  to train the participants in rational group work on a development task the course is run together with course 34229 meaning that there often are groups with participants at different levels
