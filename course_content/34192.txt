the articles studied during the course will cover some of the hottest research topics in modern optical communications  the topics will include high capacity and spectrally efficient data transmission in optical fibres  spatial multiplexing  silicon photonics  optical signal processing etc   see keywords   a number of potential papers topics will be presented at the beginning of the course seminar discussion group  every week  a specific journal paper is studied and discussed by all participants  as preparation for the seminar  the participants are divided into groups who cooperate on studying and understanding the paper  at the seminar  the groups meet to present and discuss the paper to practice reading  critical evaluation  and scientific discussion of state of the art scientific journal articles  to obtain an overview of some of the currently most important research topics in the field of optical communications the course will be held in 2022keywords  some of the possible topics   high capacity and high spectral efficiency optical data  super channels  orthogonal frequency division multiplexing  optical ofdm   nyquist wavelength division multiplexing  nyquist wdm   spatial multiplexing  multicore  and multimode optical data transmission   silicon photonics  non linear optical signal processing  optical parametric processes  time lenses  optical regeneration
