the course treats basic and advanced theory and methodology in the assessment appraisal evaluation of major investment projects for transport infrastructure  however  the methods applied are universal and can be used for other types of projects as well  knowledge about transport infrastructure projects is not a prerequisite to participating in the course   the overall issue of the course is to apply socio economic analysis using cost benefit analysis  cba   strategic analysis using multi criteria decision analysis  mcda   and feasibility risk assessment and combine them to a composite analysis for a pool of investment projects to provide the best possible decision support  the following topics will be treated in lectures and exercises  where it is assumed that the student holds some basic knowledge in economics   socio economic analysis  basic methodology behind the cba  the students will learn how to apply the method to analyze major investments over a long time horizon   feasibility risk assessment  theory and methodology concerning uncertainty calculations and the concept of optimism bias  a topic here is determining various uncertain elements in the socio economic analysis   strategic analysis  theory and methodology concerning measuring non quantifiable impacts  which often are strategic and hold the potential to improve the decision support  the students will get acquainted with different mcda assessment techniques depending on the decision situation and how to combine these with the results from the cost benefit analysis and feasibility risk assessment  the aim is to include the sustainability perspective in the final recommendations   the course participants work in groups to apply and achieve practical knowledge about the analysis methods and concepts  it is expected that the students can clarify account argue for the chosen impacts criteria and the model solutions in connection with the report work and the written examination    the main course content consists of lectures and group exercises with plenary discussions lectures  exercises and a final group reportcompendium material and scientific articles regarding the applied methods the course aims to give the participants a theoretical and practical basis for advanced decision support consisting of socio economic appraisal using cost benefit analysis  strategic analysis using multi criteria decision analysis  and feasibility risk assessment  the main issue in this respect will be to model and establish adequate decision support within a specific appraisal study context with a particular emphasis on the strategic impacts and the uncertainties involved  in the modeling approach  excel based applications of cost benefit analysis  multi criteria decision analysis  and feasibility risk assessment will be applied when setting up and designing the decision support model
