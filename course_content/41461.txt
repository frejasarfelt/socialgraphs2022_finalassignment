the course will explain the basic principles of photovoltaic conversion and installation of photovoltaic systems  along with pvt panels and systems  details are provided in other courses e g  photovoltaic systems  afterwards  building material   and aesthetic requirements will be explained  and technologies to achieve good aesthetics will be presented  principles for estimation of the generated energy will be presented  and examples of how the energy contributes to the energy frame of the building will be explained  the requirements of the building structure as a consequence of bipv is explained  also  the changes to the building envelope in terms of moisture properties is presented  examples will be presented and guest lectures will share their experiences lectures  assignments and group project workthis course will provide building designers with knowledge of pv and pvt and enable them to use building integrated photovoltaics  bipv  solutions in their building design  similarly the course will provide solar engineers with the understanding of the requirements for bipv products seen from the buildings perspective  the participants will also acquire knowledge about aesthetic requirements and be familiar with technologies for balancing aesthetics and efficiency  the participants will also be presented with principles and safety matters for photovoltaic installations as well as being able to estimate the energy generated from a bipv installation and how this energy impacts the energy frame for the building
