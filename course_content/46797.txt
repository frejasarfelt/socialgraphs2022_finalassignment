the exact project and theme will be agreed between the student and a technical project supervisor chosen by the student in connection with the enrollment  eventure supports all engineering disciplines related to emobility  eg  electronics  power  structural  aerodynamic  thermal  storage engineering to name a few this course consists of technical introductory lectures after which students are grouped in the teams according to their preference and knowledge and tasked with design and analysis  for electric vehicle components with the primary goal to contribute to the student competitions eventure is participating in rules for fse  books  eg  advanced electric drive vehicles by ali emadi   etc  research papers  components data sheetsthe objective of the course is to allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems relating to modern electrical vehicles    this course is offered as a part of the dtu eventure blue dot project  dtu eventure currently supports projects relating to formula student competitions  roskilde festival projects and international future energy challenge    due to aforementioned  formula student electric race car developed by dtus fse team  vermilion racing  part of eventure  is used as the hardware platform and framework for problem formulation    as a part of the course  students will  with the help of the professor  define a project scope relevant to the racecar platform and within abilities interests of students   students are encouraged to contact course responsible  nm elektro dtu dk  before signing up for this course for further clarifications   dtus formula student team  https   vermilionracing com this course is thought in spring semester  13 week period   minor changes will be implementet so it will be more clear that this and course 46795 are not identical and students can follow both courses
