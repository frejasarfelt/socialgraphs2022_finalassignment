the course will start with a short description of the field as it has developed since its inception at the beginning of the space age  this is followed by a theoretical introduction to x ray telescopes and detectors  this will include all relevant solid state physics aspects   covering reflection and scattering from mirrored surfaces and the various types of absorption and interaction in solid state detectors  finally  the course will contain an introduction to the analytical and numerical methods used for the simulation of the scientific capabilities of realistic instrument complexes and a description of the requirements lectures  13 uger  5 ects  selected chapters from two books   modern x ray physics  by des mcmorrow and j a nielsen  radiation detection and measurements  by g f knoll   selected articlesto give an in depth understanding of modern scientific instrumentation for x  and gamma ray astronomy  this will include both the telescopes and detector side the course focuses on the development of space instrumentation and future space technology  the experimental part of the course is offered in the june 3 week period in course 30788 the laboratory exercises on x ray mirrors and detector prototypes are part of the complementary course 30788 offered in the 3 week period of june  5 ects  scientific instrumentation for x  and gamma ray astronomy
