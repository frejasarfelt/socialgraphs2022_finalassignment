the landing obligation implemented with the common fisheries policy in european waters is a game changer for the fishing sector  solutions for avoiding unwanted catch  which previously could be discarded  are high in demand  after an overview of the commercial fishing sector  this course introduces the most common fishing methods  the students will be familiarized with the biology and behavior related to the catchability of the most important commercial species  and the technical and biological principles that influences selectivity of active and passive fishing gears  the students will be presented to behavioral and morphological aspects of size and species selectivity in a gear as well as how to observe the geometry of the gear and behavior of the catch  furthermore  methods to analytically assess the selective properties of a gear based on the composition of the retained catch will be introduced  the students will get to know design principles for modifying gears to increase selectivity of unwanted catch or minimize environmental impact  an introduction to sustainable fishing will be given and principles of the technical legislation and methods for controlling the compliance of fishing gears will be presented  the students will work with theoretical and hands on assignments in groups  from which they will produce small reports and select one for presentation in plenary lectures  guest lectures  group based problem solving  written assignments  hands on exercisethis course introduces the student to the different engineering and technological aspects of fishing gears  and common ways of modifying gear designs to alter the catch composition in accordance with the interest of different stakeholders  the student will become familiar with the biology of important commercial species and the behavioral mechanisms relevant to the catchability and selectivity of different capture methods  environmental impacts of different gear types that will be introduced includes seabed impact  co2 emissions  and discards  this includes physical and biological impacts on the environment of different types of fishing gears  the societal importance of developing fishing gears will be given in the perspective of sustainability and management through technical measures at a global and regional scale  but with emphasize on denmark  this course is recommended as a base for students that want to proceed with the courses 25336 or 25616 to obtain more in depth knowledge and skills in relation to fishing gear technology and innovation general competence course  msc  eng   aquatic science and technologythe course provides the necessary basic knowledge for students interested in progressing academically or as a stakeholder within subjects interacting with fishing gears at any level   this course is recommended as a base for students that want to proceed with the courses 25336 and 25616 to obtain more in depth knowledge and skills in relation to gear technology innovation  this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  2  zero hunger    12  responsible consumption and production  and  14  life below water   but also  9  industry  innovation  and infrastructure  and  13  climate action
