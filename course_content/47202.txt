the background and the challenges in relation to the energy system are outlined with a view to climate  resources and security of supply  key concepts and principles of thermodynamics and electrochemistry necessary to discuss and understand energy technologies are presented  the most important energy sources and their technologies for exploitation are introduced  i e  solar  wind  hydro power  biomass and nuclear   energy conversion and storage is treated as a means for handling energy on the large scale  it covers physical and in particular chemical storage  electrolyzers  fuel cells  power to fuel concepts  batteries  chemical storage lectures alternating with varied student activities  group work  assignments  discussions   teachers from all the participating departments contribute  a mandatory midterm assignment in groups will be given  it is a prerequisite for taking the exam  but is not part of the final grading the written teaching material is made available via learn without costs the course will introduce the main energy technologies constituting the future renewable energy system that is not reliant on fossil fuels  students will gain a thorough and up to date understanding of the challenges and opportunities in a future sustainable energy system  this is done with special emphasis on the technical challenges and the resource limitations  the student will be able to perform a critical analysis of the potential constraints and quantitative challenges of the different technologies  e g  what improvements are required possible  the course is as a broad introduction providing an overview of options and challenges and thus priming the student for going deeper into selected subjects in later courses which technologies will pave the way for a future  sustainable energy system  come and learn the course is particularly relevant to the following study programmes  bachelor in design of sustainable energy systems  or physics and nanotechnology  or chemistry and technology  or production and construction  or electro technology  or general engineering  or similar  however  students from all study programmes are welcome
