the course consists of presentations and discussions of scientific articles within the physics of fluids  in particular  the papers will be selected in key areas of biofluids  microfluidics  and acoustofluidics  the papers will be either classical seminal papers or recent breakthrough papers in the field  and will be chosen in agreement with the course responsible    every two weeks  one research paper is presented followed by a discussion with all the participants  the presenter can be a student or an invited speaker  however each student is required to prepare and present at least 2 papers within the course  the paper and presenter are announced one week in advance to allow the presenter to prepare the presentation  and the listeners to study the paper and prepare questions for the discussionthe course consists of presentations and discussions of scientific articles within the physics of fluids  with focus on biofluids  microfluidics  acoustofluidics the required literature consists of the papers presented during the course in agreement with the course responsible to provide the participants with knowledge about classical and recent research within biofluids  microfluidics  acoustofluidics  or other key areas in the physics of fluids  you will learn to critically analyze scientific papers and to practice scientific discussion and presentation the course should be followed for two semesters to obtain 5 ects
