this is a three week intensive summer course of which 10 days are based in hirtshals  northern denmark  in close proximity to the danish fishing industry  research vessels and the facilities at the north sea science park  the course will cover a range of the main fish capturing methods and the different steps of their underlying technological and biological principles  the effect of fish capturing process on the stocks  the product and on the environment will be described and discussed in relation to present and future management strategies for biological and economical sustainable fisheries  the design principle  innovations and development of fishing gears and methods  will be explained and demonstrated through lectures  excursions to net makers  commercial fishing vessels and the hirtshals trawl flumetank  computer exercises will be used to demonstrate methods to analyze the selective properties of fishing gears   the students will in groups plan and conduct an experimental selectivity sea trial  each group will go one day onboard rv havfisken testing a selective fishing gear in a twin trawl configuration at sea  each group will critically evaluate the collected data  analyze the data and present the data as a scientific draft manuscript which is presented at the oral examination    the course provides the necessary basic understanding for students interested in progressing academically or as a stakeholder within subjects interacting with fishing gears at any level lectures  computer exercises  experimental sea trial  field studies and student presentations  5 days of intensive lectures  student presentations and computer exercises  1 day at sea  and 4 days of critical evaluation of collected data  data analysis and scientific presentation of data  manuscript form  and preparation to familiarize the student to the commercial fishing sector and the fisheries regulatory system and provide an in depth understanding of the technical and biological principles behind a range of the most important commercial fishing methods used  to understand both size  and species selectivity in fishing gear and how to assess both fish behavior and the mechanical aspects of selectivity  to develop design principles of fishing gear that meet the criteria for current and future management strategies for both biological and economical sustainable fisheries   the course will specifically provide an in depth practical experience in planning and conducting an at sea selectivity trial on dtu aqua s research vessel havfisken  the students will critically evaluate the collected data  choice of analytical method  and modelling approach  finally  the students will present the selectivity data in relation to current management strategy and available scientific literature as a scientific manuscript it is recommended for the students to attend the course 25335 or similar introductory courses in fisheries technology before attending this course  but this is not a prerequisite   phd students must pay a fee of 3000 ddk to cover seagoing activities   this course provides students with competences relevant to un sdgs  particularly  2  zero hunger    12  responsible consumption and production  and  14  life below water
