introduction to food safety  foodborne diseases and food spoilage in a historical perspective  the kinetics of bacterial growth and the factors that may alter this  water activity  low ph  temperature  preservatives   the microbiota of different classes of food products from farm to fork and more  fermentation of food products  the biology and epidemiology of foodborne pathogens of public health significance  bacterial evolution and emerging threats  how do bacteria acquire novel biological traits  the bacterial genome and its evolution  emerging food pathogens and transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria via the food chain  novel intervention strategies and methods in outbreak investigations  food control at different levels plus novel tools for preventing food borne disease e learningfood is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogenic microorganisms  bacteria  viruses  and parasites  can reach and infect humans  in the  microbial food safety in a global perspective  course  you will learn about the occurrence  spread and transmission of microbiological hazards in the food chain from one health point of view  the course focuses on current and emerging microbiological threats  including the spread of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens from animals to humans via food  by providing students with a thorough introduction to the biological characteristics of all relevant food borne microbial pathogens  we will explain why disease outbreaks caused by the different microbial pathogens are associated with the intake of specific type of foods  additionally  we will introduce students to the kinetics of bacterial growth and the physical factors that alter this  water activity  low ph  temperature  preservatives  in food  we will explain the bacterial responses to factors limiting growth and virulence factors of food borne pathogens at the molecular level  finally  the evolution of the bacterial genome and the adaptability of bacteria in response to selective pressures will be a continuous focus area  and the dna based methods used in outbreak investigations will be explained  we will discuss international food safety regulation and novel intervention strategies to strengthen microbial food safety in a global perspective  the course teachers are all leading experts in the field of microbial food safety the course is offered in even years  2022  2024  2026 etc
