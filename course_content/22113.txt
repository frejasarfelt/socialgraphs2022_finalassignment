this course provides an introduction to unix  which is widely used in bioinformatics  you learn basic commands  file manipulation  input   output redirection  file system structure and process manipulation  the course builds on the existing knowledge of python  and you learn about regular expressions  advanced data structures  functions  python s object model  classes  unit tests  and scientific libraries  this is done under an umbrella of exercises based on bioinformatics and data analysis problems  the exercises must be peer evaluated and integrated with the lectures  students in groups of two will get a minor programming project during the course  possibly a project of their own design  individual contributions to the project must be stated to facilitate individual grading  a student  will also peer evaluate another groups project lectures and computer exercisesthe student should be able to solve bioinformatic problems in a structured manner using python in a unix environment  for example during project work  it is an important goal to teach the student how to think when programming the course will run for the first time in spring 2023  for an introduction to python  see 22101 which is a recommended prerequisite to 22113 repeaters can reuse previously accepted exercises and project
