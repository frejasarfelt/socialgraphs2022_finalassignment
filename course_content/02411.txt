main principles in experimental design  randomisation and blocking  balanced designs  square designs  one or more blocking variables  balanced incomplete block designs  factorial designs  blocking in factorial designs  fractional factorial designs and confounding  multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance lectures and tutorials to acquaint the students with efficient statistical methods that may serve as basis for the planning of experiments and research activities  the methods aim at providing precise and reliable data and moreover to reduce the experimental work as much as possible  methods for reduction of the influence from noise factors on experimental results are presented the course is primarily aimed at students that are going to design experiments and or analyse experimental data  but the general methods presented are also suited for sharpening the critical sense in experimental work  method development and empirical model building
