the course  finite element methods  focuses on theoretical lectures combined with computer exercises in matlab and fortran in groups of two  subjects covered include  the principle of virtual work  truss elements  isoparametric elements and numerical integration  solution of large systems of equations  explicit and implicit non linear incremental solution methods  geometric and material non linearities and topology optimization  as a part of the course  the students will build their own finite element code and apply it to model simple geometries  commercial finite element codes will only be used for pre processing  choice of final project  see suggestions above  may depend on prerequisites lectures and computer exercisescook  malkus  plesha and witt   concepts and applications of finite elements analysis   wiley  4th edition  2002 computational modelling of the mechanical response of engineering parts  structures and devices is a basic engineering discipline with ever growing applications  also within industry 4 0  digital twins  biomechanics  life sciences and additive manufacturing  am   the finite element method  fem  constitutes the all dominating computational approach to modelling of solids and also covers applications and couplings to multiple other physical domains like fluids  acoustics  thermodynamics and electromagnetism  the goal of the course is to teach the students basic and advanced fem through theory development  extensive programming of own fe codes and applications within linear and non linear elasticity   the final part of the course constitutes a larger programming project  where students can choose between subjects including  but not limited to  transient analysis  coupled thermomechanical problems  fluid structure interaction  plates  plasticity or acoustic structure interaction  some of them possibly combined with structural design through topology optimization the course has changed name from  fem heavy  to  finite elements methods  in e20
