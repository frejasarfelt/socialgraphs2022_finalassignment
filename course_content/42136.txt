many important optimization problems can be modeled using mixed integer programming models  when these models cannot be solved using standard solver software  decomposition algorithms can be applied to solve the problems iteratively  the methods are    benders decomposition   dantzig wolfe decomposition column generation  the course will give the students a thorough introduction to the two types of algorithms and enable to use them as solution methods for various problems lectures  excercises and project work course notes the aim of the course is to give a thorough introduction to decomposition algorithms  this will enable the students to solve complex optimization problems  furthermore the student is trained in applying the algorithms and implementing them in juliacourse on advanced decomposition algorithms for solving large scale optimization  mixed integer programmig problems to optimality  during the course the student will both study the theory and implement the algorithms on hard problems the course is quantitatively oriented and a good understanding of linear programming is necessary  in the exercises the computer language julia jump  taught in course 42112  to implement the decompositions algorithms  students with no prior knowledge of julia jump should be prepared for a significant extra workload
