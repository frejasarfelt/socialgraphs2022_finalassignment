introduction to the basic principles and methods for data science and compression incl  basics of information theory as entropy  cross entropy and mutual information  mi   the entropy is a measure of information and mutual information a measure of shared information  this includes entropy coding by huffman and arithmetic coding  decorrelation by prediction or transformation to the frequency domain and quantisation of data for lossy coding and represenation   some examples of data for compression and  analysis are presented  eg  coding and analysis of  data strings  images in the frequency domain  dct and wavelets   jpeg 2000  audio signals  and video as image sequences  one application area is coding and analysis of images  video and data from drones   midway  the students choose a project within the areas presented lectures and individual project  in groups of two to give the participants solid knowledge of the basic principles of data science and compression and methods for data compression e g  for image communication  to enable the students to implement and evaluate data analysis and compression algorithms
