week 1  introduction to smart energy systems control problems  and distributed control  systems  the differences between a simulated and actual distributed control system   introduction to physical laboratory facilities  lab safety and remote control of syslab units  implementing communication in a distributed system   week 2  coordination and fault tolerance strategies  implementation of a control system on a distributed testbed  testing for reproducible outcomes  deployment and evaluation of distributed controllers    week 3  control implementation and experiment execution in syslab  risø campus    presentation of results lectures  exercises  project with lab experimentas smaller sustainable energy resources come to dominate the energy system  effective operation requires local resources to coordinate  acting as a single unit to higher levels in the system  depending on how it is controlled  this coordinated energy system may be called for example a microgrid  energy community  or hybrid power plant     this course introduces the methods required to implement such a distributed system  with students demonstrating how remote sensing and control can be combined with fault tolerant communication to build a coordinated energy system   the primary focus is hands on experience in building a distributed energy system using a functional interface of the available units  applying distributed system fault tolerance and communication patterns  monitoring its operation  and testing its actual performance  the course main tools include python programming as well as linux command line operations  remote operation via ssh and collaboration tools   examples relate directly to current research developments and energy industry applications   the final project is implemented on the distributed energy system  syslab   located at risø campus   keywords  distributed systems  sensor networks  iot  communication  control  fault tolerance
