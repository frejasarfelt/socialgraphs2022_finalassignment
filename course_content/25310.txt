the course consists of five elements    ecology of marine organisms  trophic interactions from bacteria and phytoplankton to marine mammals and global scale processes including anthropogenic disturbances  presented through lectures  quizzes and guest lectures   calculation exercises to demonstrate and   or quantify selected processes in the marine environment   examples of different approaches to model biological interactions presented through lectures and exercises   hands on experience on sampling and sample analysis of plankton   group work on a real life application of biological oceanography to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activities for marine ecosystems   the first part of the course is divided between the trophic levels  phytoplankton  microbial loop  zooplankton  benthos  fish larvae and marine mammals  discussing the environmental forcing at different scales  interactions between functional groups and anthropogenic stressors  the second part of the course will focus on different modelling approaches  and on global scale processes such as the biological carbon pump and on the environmental challenges facing the changing oceans  a group work on the environmental impacts of off shore projects and the seasonal sampling campaign will run throughout the course  the course includes lectures  exercises  quizzes  model practical  sampling and laboratory analysis and group work lectures  exercises  group work book chapters  written notes  articles   handoutsbiological oceanography deals with the life in the oceans   the interactions between organisms and their physical and chemical environment  we will focus on the structure and function of marine food webs  and strive to understand how biological processes control the species interactions and their responses to environmental forcing  and how global patterns emerge from these individual interactions  the course offers a mechanistic understanding of the most important biological processes in aquatic systems and their dependency on the environment  we will present the different trophic levels and illustrate different scales of the marine environment  starting at the individual level  and advancing to population  community and global scales of the marine ecosystem  the theoretical knowledge will be compared to the observations on the development of spring bloom obtained by shore based sampling  and used in an assignment to evaluate the environmental impact of hypothetical off shore construction projects  the course will enable the students to appreciate cause consequence relationships and assess the effects of environmental changes to marine ecosystems and the global ocean   the course addresses un sustainable development goal 14  life below water   particularly its targets to prevent and reduce marine pollution  14 1  and to sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems  14 2
