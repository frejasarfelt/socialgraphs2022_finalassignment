the course addresses the design of digital systems at the rt level  the vhdl language  synthesis  and fpga technology  the focus is on writing efficient rtl code and on the relationship between vhdl constructs and the corresponding synthesized hardware implementations   design of digital systems  data path and control  pipelining  from algorithm to a circuit  performance measures  throughput and latency   the vhdl hardware description language  simulation and synthesis  introduction of fpga technology  design flow  specification  stepwise refinement  simulation  synthesis  implementation  and test   timing analysis of sequential circuits  possibly circuits suffering from clock skew    a sequence of exercises supplements the lectures and provides hands on experience using vhdl and the associated cad tools  a small project concludes the course lectures  exercises and project textbook  pong chu   rtl hardware design using vhdl   coding for efficiency  portability  and scalability    wiley  2006 to enable students to design larger digital circuits  e g   hardware accelerators  in a systematic way and to implement these in fpga technology using typical cad tools  currently  vhdl and xilinx vivado     to enable students to analyze and optimize the speed and area of a given digital circuit the course is a graduate level course  for most students  or an upper level undergraduate course  for some students with sufficient background in digital design
