this course introduces experimentation in cognitive science  and teaches engineering students how to collect  handle  and interpret human data in an ethically considerate manner    core elements    ethics and data handling in experimentation with human participants   behavioural and physiological measures in cognitive science   experimental design and analysis principles in cognitive sciencea practical course on running experiments with human participants in the field of cognitive science    lectures and lab sessions which students will use to perform an experiment by collecting behavioural and or physiological data from human participants tbaexperimentation in cognitive science is a young field  and many mysteries remain about human behaviour  perception  and performance  with the ever growing amount of human data available  and development of data science and artificial intelligence  it is a crucial time for understanding how to collect  handle  and interpret human data      this course will teach engineering students how to formulate research questions and testable hypotheses in cognitive science  use them to carry out appropriate experiments by collecting behavioural and or physiological data from human participants  and interpret the results of their experiments in the context of a wider research question within cognitive science    experiments will be conducted at the cogsys behavioural lab in groups of 3  given the limited number of experimental stations  the course is limited to 35 students
