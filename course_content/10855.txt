in the first half of the course  you will receive a thorough theoretical introduction to the various processes and tools  and you will follow tool package training in the most common lithography tools  electron microscopy tools  specific dry etching tools  and thin film deposition tools  silicon materials  as well as iii v semiconductors  metals  and carbon will be treated   in the latter half of the course  you will carry out a mini project in a small team with fellow students with the aim to fabricate a specific micro nanostructure  or microdevice  you will gain practical experience with specific processes  fabrication  and characterization tools lectures  online self study with supervision  computational exercises  and laboratory work in the clean roomonline content and electronic lecture notesin this course  you will learn how to fabricate micro  and nanostructures  and microdevices in dtus cleanroom  you will be introduced to the most advanced processes and tools in the cleanroom  and you will receive training in operating some of these tools yourself  you will learn how to engineer a specific micro nanostructure or microdevice from a starting point defined by its desired functionality  and you will learn systematic methods for how to convert this information to appropriate choices of fabrication tools  process sequences  and characterisation steps in case of overbooking  msc students in physics and nanotechnology and photonics engineering will have first priority from the start of the course  you will be offered cleanroom safety training  and training sessions for use of specific cleanroom tools  this will take place wednesdays 8 17  i e  outside of the teaching modules  hence  you should be able to reserve a number of wednesdays for those training sessions in addition to the regular course modules   you may consider those training sessions as part of the homework for the course  the training sessions will be agreed on an individual basis for all course students  in connection to the hands on training sessions  you will also have to do self study of online materials regarding the appropriate use of specific tools and safety measures  subsequently  your understanding of these materials will be evaluated through a number of quizzes  which must be passed before the corresponding hands on training can be agreed  during the mini project phase  you must be prepared to be flexible regarding organization of your work  as availability of tools in the cleanroom may require working outside of the scheduled course modules advanced micro  and nanofabrication technology  introduction to cleanroom based microfabrication
