role of fermentation and biocatalysis in the sustainable manufacture of industrial products  stoichiometry of cellular reactions  redox balances  yield coefficients and black box models  evaluation of the feasibility of fermentation  biocatalytic  two stage fermentation and in situ product removal processes in an industrial context  growth kinetics  thermodynamics of bioreactions and heat balances  atp balances and energetics  scale up and design of fermentation and biocatalytic processes  integration of protein engineering  metabolic engineering and process engineering lectures and exercisesthe reactors used in the bio industries are designed according to the same general principles as those elsewhere in the chemical industry  however  there are some specific characteristics of bio reactions  fermentation and biocatalysis  which require specialist treatment  such as the complex stoichiometry and thermodynamics  using a quantitative approach  bio reactions are analyzed with respect to feasibility and scale up for the production of bio based products the course can only be taken by students in sdc program   chemical and biochemical engineering  biomass and energy the course is equivalent to dtu course 28345bioreaction engineering principles  3rd edition  2011  jens nielsen  john villadsen and gunnar lid√©n
