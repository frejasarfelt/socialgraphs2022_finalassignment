modern photonics research and technology is increasingly reliant on efficient numerical methods for accurate modeling of the optical properties of advanced components such as high index waveguides  microstructured fibres  microresonators or nanostructured systems such as metamaterials  photonic crystals  etc  there is also an increasing interest in using nonlinear effects for all optical signal processing so a basic knowledge of numerical modeling tools for both linear and nonlinear optical phenomena is important for anyone doing photonics research and development  this course aims to give its participants a basic understanding of common numerical methods  emphasizing both the underlying mathematics  algorithmic issues encountered in their implementation  and their performance in solving important photonics problems  the following numerical methods are studied during the course  finite difference time domain method  finite difference frequency domain method and split step fourier method lectures with computer based exercises to make the participants familiar with modeling of modern photonics components using the finite difference method in the time and frequency domains  the participants will also learn to model the propagation of pulses over long distances in optical fibers under the influence of nonlinearity by using the split step fourier method  finally stationary mode structures will be calculated by solving the equivalent boundary value problem other teachers  ole bang  lyngby campus  building 343 oban fotonik dtu dk phone  45 25 63 73
